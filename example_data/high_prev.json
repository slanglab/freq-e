The Goodwich not only takes it too another level but always looking too improve there menu (hence change the foie up little bit) and add on new things. Just shows me the passion Jack and Josh have for food. Their background in fine dining really shows because there not single sandwich that ordinary by ANY means. Look no further then star attraction the Foie who would think make sandwich with Foie. Creative side adding mouse and crispy chicken skin. The menu goes on and on. Talk about affordable and simple straight forward menu sandwich 3,5,7,9. Then if want too go off the grid add on chicken skin, fried egg, foie, cheese, or bacon for extra cost. Sp you can literally create different master sandwich every visit. No chain sandwich that can say that or compete with these guys. \n\nI really really wanted get the Foie but unfortunately they were out. You can text in your order so if really want the Foie might be good idea. It the rave sandwich and seems like they run out earlier then later. Hopefully next time I go they have it or need too beat Shirley B too it. Lol!! I was also eyeing the Le Pig either way psyched too finally get my Goodwich sandwich on. The Le Pig was unbelievable awesome! I love my FRIED EGG think beautiful condiment or compliment on any sandwich. The Le Pig right on mark again. The belly, fontina, rocket, truffle vinagrette, chip bits and then bring all together with fried egg. Every bite was heavenly. The bread..........Sandwich not only the filling but starts with the bread. You have couple options (white, wheat, rye) I went with the standard white. Why the bread awesome! It not thin slice nor is it over thick but just right amount that gets perfect golden crust on flat top and still moist with every bite. Nom. NOM. I got bag of chips wanted the pickle chips but unfortunately they were out. The jalapeno bag of chips just as good with my sandwich. \n\nTalk about personality coming full circle not only with the food. The fact that basically taco stand so no places too sit down. Couple tables but when its packed basically eating wherever find place too grub. I love that fact! Plus talk about greatest free entertainment. I brought friend visiting from out of town. Between seeing couple gentlemen club dancers getting off work from OG across the street, or two shady\/homeless swearing profanity and acting crazy. Made it ever more of one of kind experience only in Vegas. If save room for dessert AOF literally right across the parking lot. HUGE fan and guarantee be coming back more often.

I've had samplings of The Goodwich at events, but this was my first official visit (I KNOW, I'm so behind) and of course, the only thing I can think is: Why did it take me so damn long to get here??? FACEPALM.\n\nSandwiches are available on white, wheat, or marbled rye. RYE ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. I love rye so much. I ordered rye on two of the three sandwiches and the other was white bread. Delicious, beautiful white bread.\n\nFun Guy ($5): Roasted mushroom, sweet garlic fondue, and fried onion. Whoa, this sandwich has got it going on with so few ingredients. I like mushrooms, but I don't love mushrooms; especially when the dish is an ode to mushrooms. This sandwich has a beautiful and subtle mushroom essence with a really flavorful cheese element.\n\nFalafel ($7): Green pea falafel, chickpea puree, cucumber, and kale slaw. This is an amazing vegetarian option with punches of flavor. It was my least favorite of the bunch, but still really solid. The falafel was delicious and I loved the crunch of cucumbers and kale slaw. \n\nChicken ($7): Root veg confit, salsa verde, provolone, and crispy skin. I had to save the best for last. I want to marry this sandwich (sorry, Ruben). The flavors are INSANE. All of it. The whole sandwich was pure magic. When I did manage to speak between the muffled bites of pure bliss, all I could say was, \"OHMYGOD!\" BTW, get this sandwich on rye.\n\nIn case you don't know the drill, you can text 702-910-8681 to place an order prior to your arrival with 1) Your name, 2) The sandwich, and 3) Bread choice. They've also introduced online ordering on their website recently!

Perfectly grilled and plenty of corned beef. Just the right amount of kraut and dressing to balance everything.\n\nFluff & Nutt ( white monticristo style) Nutella, toasted marshmallow and crunch.

I remembered that it was also opening day at The Goodwich, the newest business to occupy that little kiosk in front of Dino's made famous by Viva Las Arepas, and how ROAR-some (2) it would be if I could make it there after work. Arriving a few minutes before 1am, I was just in time to place the last order of the night. Hot dog! (3)\n\nI ordered the Fluff & Nutt on white bread, Monte Cristo style. My total was $3.78 including a $0.50 charge for the Monte Cristo preparation. I had a chance to chat with Jake, one of the owners, while the cook worked on my order. Jake and his business partner Josh are seasoned chefs who have worked in the kitchens of Michael Mina, Charlie Palmer, and Bradley Ogden, to name a few. Nearly every sandwich ingredient, from corned beef to foie gras mousse, is made fresh at The Goodwich. White, wheat, and rye sandwich breads are sourced from local artisan bakery Bon Breads.\n\nThe Fluff & Nutt includes Nutella, toasted marshmallows, and crunch (something coconutty.) Monte Cristo was a good choice, as the result was like Nutella french toast mixed with campfire s'mores. The savory options are perfect if you'll be crossing the street to Art of Flavors for gelato after (or before!)

We ordered the Foie and the Le Pig. Both were excellent sandwiches and were well thought out. \n\nLet's start with the Le Pig. This had a great balance of both flavor and texture. The lime ginger radish\\slaw went well with the rich pork and the crunchy texture of the chicharones made it all come together. It somewhat reminded me of a torta (Mexican sandwich) without the beans. \n\nThe Foie was a little bit more interesting. The Foie pate was paired with somewhat of a cabbage jam which made it a little sweet and chicken skin which again added the crispy texture. In my opinion I would have added a few more extra pieces of chicken skin as it got masked by the strong flavor of the foie. I would recommend getting either their house pickles or their pickled beets along with this sandwich to cut through the richness of the sandwich.\n \nI want to come back and try a few of their other sandwiches, maybe even create my own (fried egg with lots of chicken skin and bacon) mmmm I can feel my heart slowing down.\n \nIf you're looking for a late night spot to go after a few drinks downtown this would be the perfect place to satisfy your cravings.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":4,"date":"2014-04-18","useful":3,"counts":{"all":1,"mexican":1,"through":1,"skin":3,"go":1,"flavor":2,"perfect":1,"le":2,"interesting":1,"had":1,",":1,"texture":3,"late":1,"to":5,"jam":1,"rich":1,"good":1,"richness":1,"good-location":1,"bit":1,"torta":1,"crunchy":1,"sandwich":3,"try":1,"either":1,"night":1,"went":1,"pork":1,"house":1,"goodwich":1,"bacon":1,"pickled":1,"decided":1,"pickles":1,"chicken":3,"out":2,"even":1,"for":1,"lots":1,"looking":1,"radish\\slaw":1,"masked":1,"got":1,"can":1,"satisfy":1,"be":1,"we":1,"cut":1,"let":1,"along":1,"strong":1,"come":2,"by":1,"both":2,"about":1,"balance":1,"getting":1,"of":9,"place":2,"(":2,"opinion":1,"or":1,"own":1,"extra":1,"feel":1,"sweet":1,"hearing":1,"down":1,"crispy":1,"your":1,"lime":1,"little":2,"would":3,"their":3,"create":1,".":13,"few":3,"recommend":1,"was":2,"start":1,"more":2,"great":1,"back":1,"mmmm":1,"ginger":1,"somewhat":2,"excellent":1,"pig":2,"with":5,"me":1,"made":2,"this":4,"paired":1,"'re":1,"cravings":1,"were":2,"fried":1,"my":3,"and":9,"heart":1,"ordered":1,"have":1,"well":2,"it":4,"slowing":1,"pieces":1,"goodwiches":1,"as":1,"want":1,"in":1,"check":1,"if":1,"!":1,"again":1,")":2,"things":1,"reminded":1,"other":1,"sandwiches":2,"which":2,"beans":1,"you":1,"many":1,"added":2,"'s":1,"after":2,"spot":1,"chicharones":1,"cabbage":1,"foie":4,"a":9,"downtown":1,"pate":1,"beets":1,"i":5,"maybe":1,"drinks":1,"wifie":1,"together":1,"thought":1,"without":1,"so":1,"the":18,"egg":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":3}

No, not for OG's, but for AOF.  So, it was just a matter of time that I would finally get a chance at the Goodwich.  \n\nYou see the review rating.  So, that means that I'm no different than the previous Yelpers that reviewed this place.  The Goodwich is \"as good as it gets!\" when it comes to their sandwiches.  I got their Reuben-ish on wheat, which consist of corned beef, swiss, kraut, and 1000 Island type dressing.  Not quite sure what made this sandwich one of the best I've had in a while.  Not sure if it was because their bread was perfectly grilled, the corned beef & swiss smashed to a flavorful goodness, or the mix of toppings complimented my sandwich just right.  Regardless of what made my sandwich at the Goodwich a greatwich, they have convinced me that I've been missing out this whole time.  Whatever it was, it was good and I can't wait for another cheat meal here.  \n\nPS:  Prior to eating here, I thought I'd be one of the few Yelpers that gave the Goodwich less than 5 stars.

I brought my husband, I went on my own, we drove far (verrrry far) to get there, and did anything we could to get more of those sandwiches. The next week, we came a couple times and if I could get my hubby who is not a sandwich fan to come back, I guess that means it's pretty good. \n\nMy favorites are the ham (good as monte cristo), patty (oh so guilty after eating it but oh so good! appears to be creamed cheese mixed with hamburger meat, wow bad but tastes so good), and the reuben. The hubby loves the chicharon and keeps finding a way to sneak it on the sandwiches. Tsk tsk. \n\nThe reuben is really outstanding. The mixture of flavors is perfect. I love the kraut they use and the bread is really top notch. I hate rye bread and this bread is out of this world. \n\nBoth the hubby and I were not Le Pig fans, even though we both like pork belly. \n\nI also love homemade pickles, but for $2 I got 3 slices of a pickle (not 3 pickles, 3 slices) that is way overpriced. \n\nThe wait for your food is long, and has been each time I come. I understand why though since there is just one cook, so I am not knocking them for it. Just expect a wait.\n\nThe location is very \"interesting.\" Great place to people watch, see strippers and valet and all kinds of people from OG cross the street (legally and illegally, almost getting run over at times), homeless people, walk by customers that once they see the price they walk the other way, freaks, and more. \n\nThere are only a couple chairs, so be ready to take it home, eat in your car, or stand in eat. Those seats were only occupied once out of the many times I have been here. I wish there was a little table next to every chair. My chair I sat at had no table and it made it difficult to eat, put your drink down,purse, etc. It would be nice to provide a small table to each set of chairs. You can also text your order ahead of time so you don't have to wait. Love that option!\n\nWhat I don't like is the extra charge to use a credit card. I understand under $5 charge to use the card is pretty typical but not when you are spending way above that on a couple sandwiches. I am hoping they can find a way to not charge customers to use their card. I believe using a credit card vs. paying cash is pretty common.

He works there, he should be able to recommend a sandwich.  Apparently that was tough for him, as he said \"they're all good.\"  I believe it, but I believe when a customer asks for a recommendation, you can list your 1 or 2 favorites.\n\nI mentioned some sandwiches Yelp users mentioned, and he asked with a smirk if I was looking at Yelp.

Anything from Asian to European to Hawaiian to Latin and everything in between. Among all of these places in Vegas there is a little gem that I happened to stumble upon one day, The Goodwich. I have always been a fan of sandwiches and never mind paying top dollar for something that is good. I saw their prices and assumed a cheaply thrown together sandwich that I'd more than likely be disappointed with. Boy was I suprised. The sandwich I received (the ham sandwich) ended up being one of the most delicious things I've tasted since moving here. It is a perfectly stacked tower of deliciousness. They aren't little either. It is a good sized sandwich for a killer price. Personally of they raised their prices I would still come and indulge on a regular basis. I patronize this establishment at least a couple of times a week and will continue to do so regularly.  I have been trying other sandwiches and have come to the conclusion that these guys have that thing vegas has been missing. The Goodwich is a must while in Vegas for visitors and should be your regular spot as a local.

I had it all planned the day before, however, I finished the climb waaaay sooner than I anticipated. I was texting my order to Jake (one of the owners of The Goodwich) while I was waiting inside Dino's Lounge. He even delivered it to me inside Dino's. Talk about service deluxe!\n\nYou can get your Sammie in white, wheat or rye. Get it done Monte Cristo-style for 50 cents. Add-ons start at 50 cents to $4: Chip bits, fried egg, bacon, crispy chicken skin and foie gras. For sides, they have: chips, pickles, pickled chips and pickled beets (not always on the menu so, ask). Drinks: water, soda, house infusions and shandy. If you're like me and want to skip lines, text your order in to 702-910-8681 and specify if you're picking up curbside or Dino's Lounge. Give them about 20 minutes to get your food ready depending on how much food you order and how busy they are. \n\nI was extremely hungry so I got 4 sammies: Le Pig, Foie, Span-ish and Fluff & Nut...all in wheat bread.\n\nLe Pig:\nPork belly, rocket, fontina, truffle vinaigrette and chip bits. The pork belly chunks are fatty and the chip bits add saltiness and crunch to this sandwich. Lots of incredible flavors. My favorite out of all I've tried. 5\/5\n\nFoie:\nFoie gras mousse, cabbage, crisp chicken skin and almond. Creamy and rich foie gras with a bit of texture from the cabbage and almonds. The chicken skin is crisp with a thin layer of meat. A close 2nd favorite of mine. 5\/5\n\nSpan-ish:\nMortadella, manchego, chorizo, olive and piquillo. The olive and piquillo combination reminds me of giardiniera. Altogether, this sandwich resembles a muffuletta but with better ingredients and less layers. It's salty, tangy and delicious! 4\/5\n\nFluff and Nut:\nNutella, marshmallow fluff and crunch. The marshmallow is ooey gooey. The creamy chocolate hazelnut perfection that is Nutella with a sweet-salty toffee crunch. It's sweeet. 4\/5\n\nTheir hours are limited since Jake and Josh have day jobs. They're hipsters for sure. A great addition to this area. Their sandwiches are extremely amazing and it would take me a long time to get over it.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2014-03-03","useful":8,"counts":{"limited":1,"all":4,"rye":1,"rocket":1,"less":1,"skip":1,"over":1,"monte":1,"mousse":1,"mortadella":1,"skin":3,"chicken":3,"before":1,"layers":1,"702-910-8681":1,"busy":1,"20":1,"$":1,"(":2,"had":1,",":27,"texture":1,"better":1,"sweet-salty":1,"add":1,"4":2,"rich":1,"text":1,"toffee":1,"...":1,"them":1,"jake":2,"combination":1,"get":4,"food":2,"sooner":1,"anticipated":1,"scaling":1,"lunch":1,"perfection":1,"they":3,"altogether":1,"not":1,"bit":1,"one":1,"chips":2,"day":2,"bread":1,"&":1,"fluff":3,"crisp":2,"like":1,"always":1,"gras":3,"50":2,"sandwich":2,"'ve":1,"wheat":2,"have":2,"lines":1,"pork":2,"house":1,"goodwich":2,"almond":1,"bacon":1,"pickled":2,"sammie":1,"muffuletta":1,"almonds":1,"are":4,"close":1,"pickles":1,"shandy":1,"drinks":1,"even":1,"delivered":1,"hipsters":1,"for":4,"lots":1,"since":1,"nutella":2,"waiting":1,"it":7,"truffle":1,"infusions":1,"crunch":3,"after":1,"jobs":1,"think":1,"got":1,"fatty":1,"however":1,"hours":1,"le":2,"ask":1,"picking":1,"water":1,"owners":1,"sweeet":1,"of":9,"could":1,"area":1,"favorite":2,"ooey":1,"planned":1,"soda":1,"chorizo":1,"climb":1,"or":2,"marshmallow":2,"add-ons":1,"dino":3,"josh":1,"2nd":1,"done":1,"gooey":1,"delicious":1,"chunks":1,"crispy":1,"your":3,"flavors":1,"from":1,"service":1,"to":10,"addition":1,"texting":1,"long":1,".":31,"creamy":2,"much":1,"tangy":1,"white":1,":":8,"was":4,"start":1,"manchego":1,"on":2,"great":1,"but":1,"chocolate":1,"reminds":1,"finished":1,"nut":2,"hazelnut":1,"olive":2,"with":4,"than":1,"specify":1,"he":1,"me":4,"cristo-style":1,"5\/5":2,"piquillo":2,"this":3,"bits":3,"inside":2,"up":1,"can":1,"fontina":1,"i":9,"while":1,"'re":3,"thin":1,"about":2,"fried":1,"my":2,"chip":3,"and":21,"layer":1,"would":1,"saltiness":1,"waaaay":1,"give":1,"cents":2,"minutes":1,"is":3,"mine":1,"pig":2,"stratosphere":1,"salty":1,"at":1,"want":1,"in":3,"ready":1,"take":1,"their":2,"if":2,"!":2,"curbside":1,"depending":1,")":2,"that":1,"menu":1,"lounge":2,"how":2,"amazing":1,"sandwiches":1,"you":4,"out":1,"span-ish":2,"belly":2,"sure":1,"'s":5,"tried":1,"resembles":1,"coming":1,"cabbage":2,"foie":5,"extremely":2,"sides":1,"a":7,"beets":1,"vinaigrette":1,"giardiniera":1,"egg":1,"incredible":1,"sammies":1,"hungry":1,"4\/5":2,"so":2,"time":1,"ingredients":1,"the":14,"deluxe":1,"meat":1,"order":3,"talk":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":8}

They are billed as \"STACKED-RITE SANDWICHES\" and I agree!\n\nI had the pleasure of trying the \"Le Pig\" and the Foie.  These are both wonderful options.   the Le Pig (or le The Porc if you prefer) is full of flavor!  It is pork belly with a truffled vinaigrette, crunchified chip pieces, and fontina. The Foie was rich for sure with some fine foie gras mousse, cabbage, carmalized (balsamic?) onions and pieces of almond for taste,and texture.\n\nI saw a grilled cheese with a fried egg that looked inciting.  They also will do any sandwich monte cristo style for $.50.  There are lots of elevated foodie options going on here!  I hope this place does well...Dino's a great dive bar, but I'm not sure if the patrons will appreciate the more sophisticated option at the Goodwich.  I also wonder how grilled sandwiches will go over during the heat of the day as the weather warms...maybe check them out at night.

Now that they have a proper restaurant with 5 people cooking, two people checking you out, an expo and the owner running around, good luck getting your sandwich. i went in, ordered quickly and was given a number. There were only a couple customers before noon, so I expected the same speedy service. Instead, I waited 30 mins for two sandwiches, one of which was vegetarian. I went up to check on my food, was told \"they were checking on it,\" waited another 5 minutes only to be handed a bag that had been sitting there for 30 mins. When the owner himself handed me the bag and I told him that this bag *with my name on it* had been sitting there for 30 mins and I had checked on my order a couple times, he said, \"sorry, we didn't have your number.\" He made no effort to actually make the customer service experience better by offering me anything, a drink, a refund, a voucher, anything but a shoulder shrug. Let me also say that I'm a very visibly 8 months pregnant, which makes letting me stand there for 30 mins and responding rudely if not at all that much more egregious in my mind. It's a shame that such a great place has gone down hill due to ignoring the people coming in and supporting the business right in front of them.

In the middle of a dive bar parking lot, across from a Strip Club, you'll find what looks to be the remnants of a 90s staple, the one-hour photo booth. Did I nail it or DID I NAIL IT?!?\n\nBack to the important stuffs, The Goodwich is a unique sandwich oasis in the desert. I went with the thought that this can't be justified by the hype. Eh! Wrong. So wrong! \n\nThe take something seemingly so basic (sandwich bread and add a touch of class with making the interior components of a higher calibre sandwich. They're out of the league of Subway and Capriotti's. They're borderline gourmet.\n\nI've had the Cuban, the sinfully sweet Flutter Nutrer, the Porkie, the Reuben. It's all so tasty and have complex flavor profiles. The house made pickles also the dankness. Spicy and sweet. Definitely a must try if you're a pickle fan like me.\n\nAlso stepping up their legit game-ness, they sell upgraded colas. I'm such a sucker for speciality sodas. A few flavors of Izze and a few other brands are offered. Again, kicking it up a notch. \n\nYou can call\/text your orders ahead.

I really wanted to give them the red treatment but their sandwiches are a solid 4 stars. 4 stars is not bad, but I usually like to give 5 stars when the food is absolutely mind blowing. I've been here a total of 3 times so far, and I've gotten the chicken twice and le pig once. For some reason the first time I try something that is good with a unique twist such as their chicken sandwich it was practically mind blowing, but today when I had it, it was good just not amazeballs status. The chicken sandwich consist of chicken, greens, and pesto. For some reason the chicken today was a bit greaser than usual, trust me I am not one to complain about a little extra grease because it does add extra flavor with a side of guilt however today there was a little puddle of grease on the paper that holds the sandwich together. But I must give them credit for the bread they use, I am not really a ran of rye bread but theirs is really good and I love the marble effect on it(refer to my picture). I've also tried Le pig and thought it was a bit fatty for my liking. I had a bite of my friend's ham and that was really good from what I can remember and it's on the $5 menu. I also like the fact they are near the intersection of Oakey and Las Vegas Blvd., although the area is sketchy it certainly does have character to it, which I think matches urbanized vibe they are going for. Trust me although I didn't get them 5 stars, I certainly will be back for the ham and encourage others to try them out. Who knows, maybe my next experience I'll be so impressed to bump them up a star.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":4,"date":"2014-07-26","useful":2,"counts":{"all":1,"holds":1,"just":1,"food":1,"paper":1,"chicken":5,"certainly":2,"le":2,"$":1,"(":1,"solid":1,"had":2,",":13,"to":8,"add":1,"going":1,"4":3,"pesto":1,"them":5,"good":4,"get":1,"matches":1,"vegas":1,"they":4,"not":4,"bit":2,"unique":1,"complain":1,"bread":2,"like":2,"greens":1,"did":1,"'ve":3,"try":2,"twice":1,"bad":1,"intersection":1,"side":1,"because":1,"bump":1,"puddle":1,"theirs":1,"some":2,"back":1,"grease":2,"are":3,"'s":3,"liking":1,"flavor":1,"really":4,"n't":1,"what":2,"total":1,"for":6,"tried":1,"3":1,"does":2,"use":1,"red":1,"refer":1,"be":2,"blowing":2,"business":1,"however":1,"here":1,"reason":2,"although":2,"others":1,"wanted":1,"ham":2,"on":3,"about":1,"urbanized":1,"of":7,"experience":1,"times":1,"credit":1,"sketchy":1,"menu":1,"usually":1,"think":2,"first":1,"love":1,"extra":2,"character":1,"one":1,"trust":2,"impressed":1,"little":2,"from":1,"area":1,"amazeballs":1,"bite":1,"there":1,"been":1,"next":1,"absolutely":1,"stars":5,"was":6,"today":3,"treatment":1,"pains":1,"that":3,"mind":2,"but":6,"encourage":1,"with":2,"than":1,"must":1,"me":3,"consist":1,"this":1,"gotten":1,"up":1,"will":1,"near":1,"guilt":1,"can":1,".":13,"my":4,"marble":1,"and":9,"oakey":1,"give":4,"ran":1,"is":5,"am":2,"it":11,"pig":2,"twist":1,"as":2,"something":1,"have":1,"in":1,"their":2,"knows":1,"'ll":1,"once":1,")":1,"deserve":1,"rye":1,"when":2,"also":2,"5":3,"sandwiches":1,"which":1,"so":2,"out":1,"status":1,"picture":1,"sandwich":3,"star":1,"fatty":1,"who":1,"effect":1,"such":2,"friend":1,"greaser":1,"las":1,"a":12,"remember":1,"practically":1,"i":19,"maybe":1,"together":1,"thought":1,"vibe":1,"honestly":1,"time":1,"far":1,"the":15,"usual":1,"fact":1,"blvd.":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":1}

Yup, I made that word up just for this review. \n\nThe Goodwich brings it back to basics in a perfect way; bread, meat, and smiles. This permanent food cart in the parking lot of one of Vegas' oldest karaoke bars makes some of the best classic lunches in the Valley. \n\nThe menu has about twelve different sandwich options with about seven different add-ons; a fried egg, cheese, jalape\u00f1os, chicharones, chip bits, bacon, and crispy chicken skin. All these tasty tidbits can be put on a Reuben, Patty Melt, or even a PBB&J - which is house peanut butter, bacon, pepper jam. Hungry?\n\nMy third time here I ordered the Cuban-Esque, which has butt & belly, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickled mustard. I added chicharones to this to get that hard crunch. Talk about a sandwich... this was like a gourmet stoner's wet dream. The pork mixed with the pickled mustard cut the salt flavor just a tad and the marble rye bread was super soft and fresh. The chicharones brought me back to the days of putting potato chips on my schoolyard sammie, very filling and addictive. \n\nI recommend washing this down with a Classic Coke or Squirt made with Mexican sugar, which this snack stand offers in spades. They don't sell booze, but If you're looking for a beer or cocktail, head over to Dino's which is just 15 feet away. The good people at The Goodwich will deliver your food directly to you while you enjoy the latest version of, \"Don't Stop Believing\" belted out by a local karaoke king. \n\nThe Goodwhich.

Well, after my first visit to The Goodwich I just couldn't resist coming back for more just two days later.\n\nI came for lunch with some of my favorite Yelpers, one of whom is already a regular here. I shared a le pig and a foie sandwich the first time around. The sandwiches came out quickly and we settled down to eat. It was a windy afternoon and our food blew all over the place. Lesson learned for next time, if it's windy we will be taking our grub into Dino's or to go to save us the stress. There was one foie casualty during our meal, but The Goodwich guys were on top of it and a replacement sandwich was ready in no time.  The food was amazing. I'm usually 50\/50 on foie gras. Sometimes I enjoy and sometimes I don't. Both sandwiches were great. The foie had a nice sweetness and crunch that definitely improved the taste and texture, taking the sandwich to a whole new level. The le pig was delicious as well. Perfectly cooked and really tasty. It was a close tie, so it's too hard for me to pick a favorite. \n\nTwo days later, I came by with my mom to share the fluff and nutt Monte cristo style. I had heard so many good things I just couldn't resist. I actually don't normally enjoy marshmallow or Nutella but it was a nice combination with the added crunchies, making the texture very nice. There was a long line but it went quickly.\n\nThe guys who run this place are just great. They make everyone feel very welcome and are so hospitable and accommodating, it's hard not to root for them. Luckily they make a pretty darn good product on top of that so I will be back again really soon. \n\nMake sure to text or call to make sure they are there before you go. Even better, text your order in like we did so it's ready when you get there.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2014-03-15","useful":9,"counts":{"all":1,"nutt":1,"they":3,"cristo":1,"crunchies":1,"over":1,"50\/50":1,"monte":1,"windy":2,"sweetness":1,"go":2,"next":1,"before":2,"style":1,"le":2,"just":4,"had":2,",":10,"texture":2,"writing":1,"better":1,"to":10,"pretty":1,"text":2,"save":1,"do":2,"them":1,"good":2,"around":1,"combination":1,"get":1,"food":2,"soon":1,"lunch":1,"darn":1,"mom":1,"shared":1,"not":1,"during":1,"fluff":1,"like":1,"level":1,"did":1,"gras":1,"sandwich":3,"twice":1,"went":1,"meal":1,"replacement":1,"enjoy":2,"blew":1,"everyone":1,"grub":1,"be":2,"goodwich":2,"hard":2,"some":1,"back":2,"dino":1,"resist":2,"added":1,"are":3,"our":3,"out":2,"even":1,"will":2,"for":5,"review":1,"nutella":1,"new":1,"learned":1,"crunch":1,"we":3,"welcome":1,"run":1,"yelpers":1,"were":2,"here":1,"hospitable":1,"by":1,"after":1,"on":3,"great":2,"rare":1,"many":1,"could":2,"favorite":2,"days":2,"place":3,"afternoon":1,"pick":1,"usually":1,"whole":1,"or":3,"first":3,"already":1,"marshmallow":1,"feel":1,"into":1,"one":2,"down":1,"delicious":1,"lesson":1,"actually":1,"your":1,"top":2,"there":4,"visit":1,"two":2,"long":1,"quickly":2,"whom":1,"call":1,"too":1,"perfectly":1,"was":8,"more":1,"both":1,"but":3,"checking":1,"luckily":1,"improved":1,"line":1,"with":3,"eat":1,"me":1,"this":1,"accommodating":1,"up":1,"us":1,"n't":4,"of":4,"making":1,"root":1,"taking":2,"and":11,"later":2,"taste":1,"is":2,"in":2,"share":1,"it":10,"pig":2,"heard":1,"as":1,"tasty":1,"close":1,"ready":2,"my":4,"casualty":1,"if":1,"again":1,"end":1,"no":1,"things":1,"make":4,"that":3,"when":1,".":25,"amazing":1,"sandwiches":2,"tie":1,"you":2,"really":2,"nice":3,"product":1,"sure":2,"'s":5,"who":1,"regular":1,"coming":1,"'m":1,"foie":4,"guys":2,"a":13,"stress":1,"i":12,"settled":1,"sometimes":2,"well":2,"cooked":1,"definitely":1,"so":5,"time":3,"very":2,"the":15,"normally":1,"order":1,"came":3},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":7}

Honestly, I was just not blown away. I thought it was a decent sandwich, but for about 13 bucks, if I can get full just off of taste alone, then I would go to 4 stars at least.\n\nWhat I got was the Foie on wheat Monte Cristo style. As soon as I paid 12.86 (that's 9 bucks for the sandwich with 15 percent tip, tax, and another 99 cent to make it Monte Cristo), I thought to myself, damn that better be a good sandwich for 13 bucks. So after my first bite, I thought it was decent. I wasn't blown away or anything. It just seemed like just another peanut butter and jelly sandwich which later on I was told is what it kind of tastes like. Although the nice flavor of the crispy chicken skin was good, my stomach was not satisfied. I would of gotten another sandwich but then paying 20 bucks for two sandwiches just to get satisfied is not worth it.\n\nThe service was nice. The guy who took my order explained everything to me and answered all my questions. Of course you have to wait for a bit for your order because everything is made to order. I think next time I will text my order so I don't have to wait so long especially if I have time constraints.\n\nAs for their location, they are on a the corner of S Las Vegas Blvd and W Wyoming Ave across the street from OG (Olympic Gardens, a 24 hour Strip Club). They are in a small shack type of stand where Viva Las Arepas used to be. \n\nIn closing, maybe the Foie is not for me. Maybe I need to try some of the other sandwiches. Like I said, I don't see the justification in paying 10 bucks for a sandwich that wont fill me up. I will come back for sure and try the Le Pig and\/or the Reuben-ish. If I am blown away or at least impressed a bit more than the Foie, then maybe I can bump it up to a 4. I could of easily given these guys 2 stars but I had to convince myself to come back so 3 it is for now.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #91","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":3,"date":"2014-03-29","useful":11,"counts":{"monte":2,"least":2,"cristo":2,"text":1,"soon":1,"course":1,"questions":1,"skin":1,"go":1,"corner":1,"flavor":1,"before":1,"24":1,"style":1,"le":1,"20":1,"just":5,"(":2,"wyoming":1,"had":1,",":16,"12.86":1,"better":1,"to":13,"4":2,"2014":1,"worth":1,"then":3,"good":2,"get":2,"kind":1,"satisfied":2,"me":3,"vegas":1,"they":2,"not":4,"bit":3,"now":1,"wont":1,"easily":1,"like":3,"seemed":1,"sandwich":6,"try":2,"gotten":1,"small":1,"guy":1,"where":1,"reuben-ish":1,"constraints":1,"olympic":1,"because":1,"bump":1,"some":1,"back":2,"see":1,"sure":1,"are":2,"chicken":1,"n't":3,"what":2,"said":1,"for":11,"away":3,"everything":2,"3":1,"convince":1,"got":1,"365":1,"across":1,"told":1,"be":2,"full":1,"wheat":1,"here":1,"although":1,"alone":1,"come":2,"after":1,"wait":2,"on":3,"about":1,"ate":1,"ok":1,"would":2,"anything":1,"og":1,"of":9,"could":1,"jelly":1,"s":1,"stand":1,"w":1,"peanut":1,"or":2,"first":1,"blown":3,"explained":1,"expectations":1,"order":4,"long":1,"another":3,"strip":1,".":22,"crispy":1,"your":1,"impressed":1,"given":1,"from":1,"service":1,"answered":1,"decent":2,"bite":1,"two":1,"cent":1,"next":1,"their":1,"2":1,"damn":1,"stars":2,"type":1,"location":1,"a":10,"stomach":1,"that":3,"club":1,"tax":1,"took":1,"but":3,"99":1,"review":1,"91":1,"with":1,"than":1,"viva":1,"10":1,"myself":2,"made":1,"15":1,"hour":1,"these":1,"was":9,"challenge":1,"tip":1,"up":2,"will":2,"street":1,"can":2,"were":1,"closing":1,"more":1,"my":6,"and":5,"shack":1,"do":2,"taste":1,"is":5,"am":1,"it":8,"pig":1,"high":1,"blvd":1,"tastes":1,"at":2,"have":3,"in":3,"need":1,"ave":1,"as":3,"if":3,"justification":1,")":2,"make":1,"percent":1,"bucks":5,"paying":2,"other":1,"sandwiches":2,"which":1,"9":1,"honestly":1,"you":1,"fill":1,"nice":2,"all":1,"used":1,"'s":1,"who":1,"#":1,"paid":1,"and\/or":1,"foie":3,"guys":1,"13":2,"las":2,"butter":1,"arepas":1,"off":1,"especially":1,"yelp":1,"i":24,"maybe":4,"later":1,"think":1,"thought":3,"so":5,"time":2,"the":14,"gardens":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":8}

The bread they use is excellent for sandwiches.\n\nDon't be afraid to try their creative offerings as you won't be disappointed.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":4,"date":"2014-04-07","useful":3,"counts":{"all":2,"just":1,"mainly":1,"chicken":1,"find":1,"le":1,"$":2,"menu":3,"had":1,",":6,"shack":1,"location":1,"pretty":1,"has":1,"kick":1,"predecessor":1,"do":1,"outside":1,"very":1,"cutting":1,"they":2,"disappointed":1,"gem":1,"bread":1,"bar":1,"gras":1,"list":1,"try":2,"item":1,"reasonable":1,"served":1,"enjoy":2,"because":1,"goodwich":1,"second":1,"are":1,"really":1,"for":1,"creative":1,"enough":1,"got":1,"dive":1,"be":2,"we":1,"who":2,"wo":1,"3.00":1,"little":1,"let":1,"alone":1,"both":1,"could":1,"owners\/staff":1,"storefront":1,"interesting":1,"exceeds":1,"or":1,"patty":1,"number":1,"one":1,"offerings":1,".":8,"use":1,"from":1,"would":1,"to":6,"provolone":1,"there":1,"next":2,"their":4,"ranging":1,"happy":2,"``":2,"on":1,"moved":1,"but":1,"excellent":2,"with":1,"inside":1,"work":1,"say":1,"n't":3,"my":1,"and":1,"is":4,"am":1,"it":2,"pig":1,"''":2,"as":2,"itself":1,"at":1,"have":2,"in":1,"clearly":1,"afraid":1,"make":1,"when":1,"also":1,"sandwiches":1,"which":1,"you":2,"sandwich":3,"tried":1,"price":1,"after":1,"foie":1,"a":6,"i":4,"well":1,"9:00":1,"thought":1,"edge":1,"the":10,"first":1,"its":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":3}

Unless the weather is good be ready to eat in the car or take home. I'm a big fan so I've been several times. I probably would have tried more if I didn't keep getting the ruben. Here's what I've had:\n\nRuben- This is the best sandwich here. I prefer rye bread. Expect savory corned beef with swiss and kraut oozing inbetween. You should feel guilty eating this. And don't eat this with another sandwich. Get two rubens if you have to.\n\nPB&J- I don't think they have this anymore, but it's a simple sandwich I think about a lot. It had spicy jelly, peanut butter, and bacon. So good.\n\nChicken- Good sandwich, but don't eat it side by side with the ruben. It will make you think it's not that good even though it's messy and yummy. I mean it has chicken skin in it.\n\nBLT&G- thick bacon and grits patty. Also good if you don't eat it side by side with the ruben. \n\nFried Egg- I was disappointed with this one, kinda dry. To make it better get other stuff in it.\n\nCold Brew Coffee- Wasn't that strong, in fact it was watery and only bitter notes came through.\n\nI suggest calling in your order or coming when the weather is nice.

I really enjoyed the kale slaw on the sammich. Can you say yum? I also got a side of the pickled beets. They were good, but not amazing.\nI tried the fluffernutter and that was so delicious, however, I couldn't and wouldn't eat that alone. It's nice to have a few bites after you've finished your sandwich.\nThey have crazy late hours, til 1 am, so showing up at 10:30 wasn't a problem. They make the sandwich fresh and quick.

The chips, bacon, pickled stuff, etc is made in house which is awesome! I wanted to try a couple other items, but it's a little too pricey for me. My total was $17 rounded up save for tip without a drink. I understand that I got an additional dessert sandwich, but still, it's a bit too pricey for a routine lunch\/dinner. The cashier was friendly, but only one person ordered before me and it took about 10-15 minutes for my order to come out. I think last time it was less than 10 minutes with a few more people in line so not sure if that was a miss this visit.

In the same plaza, there's a bar. What goes better than beers and sandwiches? Clever, clever marketing.\n\nIt's lunchtime and I've heard great things about this place from yelp. I had a feeling this place wouldn't disappoint.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the falafel and the chicken club sandwiches, then split to share. Ranging from $3-$9, this is a perfect affordable lunch spot. \n\nThere is some seating available, but I think there's only one table and a few other chairs. Great place to grab something on-the-go! \n\nYou have a choice of white, wheat, or rye bread. There's also add-ons like fried egg ($1), chip bits ($0.50), cheese ($1), crisp chicken skin ($2), bacon ($2), and foie gras mousse ($4). I should have added chip bits to mine!\n\nFalafel: kale slaw, cucumber, and chickpea puree between two slices of bread.\nKale slaw wasn't bitter, perfectly wilted, and worked well with the cucumber for that crispy crunch. The chickpea puree in it tied it all together. Slightly chunky and dripping with just the right amount of dill sauce (I think), it was an explosion of flavor and quite filling. Delicious.\n\nChicken Club: Soft chicken bits mixed with wilted veggies, provolone, bacon, tomato, and ginger. Amazing. So tasty that I'd want my boyfriend to propose to me on the spot in the backdrop of Goodwich with me cramming this sandwich into my mouth. Greasy sandwich but oh so worth it. The flavor combination was incredible. Savory, muted sweetness from the cheese, and the fresh veggies balance it out. Also filling. The ginger wasn't overpowering and complemented the other ingredients well. \n\nIt didn't feel like there was needless ingredient in the sandwiches. All of it \"made sense.\" Even their assortment of some unique sodas and chips that you wouldn't find at the grocery store was a cool touch.\n\nThe owner actually took our order. He was funny, entertaining, and incredibly patient in answering all of our questions about the menu. Listening to him talk about old Las Vegas and his Vegas-native roots was cool. While we were waiting for our sandwiches, he kept thanking us for our patience and letting us know the status of our order when it wasn't even a long wait at all! We got a sense that he truly appreciated our business and us being there. Love his '50s old-Vegas style he's got going on. \n\nEverything from the ingredients; the carefully wrapped wax paper with the Goodwich sticker stamped on it; and the white paper bag with the logo was well-thought out. They really put so much effort into the stand's theme. It made me feel this place is one-of-a-kind, memorable. \n\nThe whole concept of Goodwich is something real, uncorporatized, and individual. A refreshing change from Downtown Project's approach (Container Park is just trying way too hard). It's just one block away from other amazing eats like Viva Las Arepas and Art of Flavors. (We hopped to Art of Flavors afterwards for a sweet contrast!)\n\nI'd love to come back and pack a few sandwiches and hit the park with picnic blankets and a book. Love this sandwich shop and all that it stands for.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2014-03-09","useful":8,"counts":{"shop":1,"all":5,"concept":1,"kale":2,"just":3,"being":1,"when":1,"mousse":1,"chickpea":2,"paper":2,"sweetness":1,"questions":1,"skin":1,"touch":1,"corner":1,"chicken":4,"find":1,"roots":1,"stamped":1,"perfect":1,"1":2,"style":2,"$":8,"(":9,"wyoming":1,"had":1,",":29,"should":1,"better":1,"to":8,"only":1,"going":1,"4":1,"old-vegas":1,"savory":1,"cool":2,"sauce":1,"worth":1,"ingredient":1,"real":1,"then":1,"his":2,"hit":1,"combination":1,"was":10,"propose":1,"choice":1,"joint":1,"vegas":2,"know":1,"listening":1,"0.50":1,"unique":1,"chips":1,"him":1,"is":5,"bread":2,"incredibly":1,"bar":1,"like":3,"'50s":1,"chairs":1,"gras":1,"with":7,"50":1,"sandwich":4,"'ve":1,"did":1,"filling":2,"?":1,"grab":1,"soft":1,"egg":1,"available":1,"seating":1,"right":1,"picnic":1,"picture":1,"crunch":1,"the":28,"goodwich":3,"hard":1,"some":2,"back":1,"carefully":1,"street":1,"table":1,"falafel":2,"wheat":1,"flavor":2,"really":1,"even":2,"n't":6,"what":1,"container":1,"stands":1,"for":5,"bag":1,"muted":1,"away":1,"everything":1,"waiting":1,"goes":1,"between":1,"it":13,"got":2,";":2,"approach":1,"across":1,"contrast":1,"affordable":1,"letting":1,"we":3,"explosion":1,"business":1,"marketing":1,"quite":1,"tied":1,"put":1,"memorable":1,"one-of-a-kind":1,"come":1,"change":1,"wait":1,"on":4,"great":2,"fried":1,"oh":1,"of":13,"plaza":1,"amazing":2,"amount":1,"place":4,"stand":2,"3-":1,"menu":1,"mixed":1,"cucumber":2,"whole":1,"think":2,"block":1,"cheese":2,"love":3,"afterwards":1,"rye":1,"slices":1,"feel":2,"sweet":1,"into":2,"one":2,"patience":1,"chunky":1,"delicious":1,"strip":1,"owner":1,"uncorporatized":1,"actually":1,"crispy":1,"assortment":1,"flavors":2,"art":2,"foie":1,"from":7,"would":2,"their":1,"provolone":1,"there":6,"they":1,"two":1,"long":1,".":39,"few":2,"or":1,"much":1,"too":1,"way":1,"wax":1,"wrapped":1,"white":2,"greasy":1,"bitter":1,"ranging":1,"store":1,"blankets":1,"tomato":1,"``":1,"clever":2,"an":1,"that":5,"club":2,"bacon":2,"well-thought":1,"about":3,"but":2,"mine":1,"downtown":1,"beers":1,"theme":1,"worked":1,"trying":1,"effort":1,"than":1,"he":4,"viva":1,"grocery":1,":":3,"this":7,"bits":3,"needless":1,"us":3,"project":1,"while":1,"individual":1,"were":1,"balance":1,"my":3,"chip":2,"pack":1,"and":26,"dill":1,"boyfriend":2,"ordered":1,"on-the-go":1,"hopped":1,"slaw":2,"sticker":1,"sense":2,"share":1,"dripping":1,"ginger":2,"add-ons":1,"''":1,"heard":1,"tasty":1,"veggies":2,"have":2,"logo":1,"blvd":1,"made":2,"!":4,"funny":1,"perfectly":1,"want":1,"something":2,")":9,"things":1,"answering":1,"incredible":1,"same":1,"thanking":1,"also":2,"old":1,"other":3,"patient":1,"split":1,"feeling":1,"disappoint":1,"sandwiches":5,"out":2,"cramming":1,"status":1,"wilted":2,"added":1,"'s":9,"book":1,"complemented":1,"our":6,"park":2,"spot":2,"me":3,"took":1,"lunchtime":1,"'d":2,"mouth":1,"a":14,"fresh":1,"appreciated":1,"truly":1,"entertaining":1,"las":3,"2":2,"arepas":1,"9":1,"in":5,"refreshing":1,"yelp":1,"lunch":1,"i":8,"slightly":1,"crisp":1,"well":2,"kept":1,"together":1,"sodas":1,"overpowering":1,"so":3,"backdrop":1,"puree":2,"you":2,"eats":1,"ingredients":2,"vegas-native":1,"at":2,"order":2,"talk":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":7}

What really sets this place apart is excellent execution: sandwiches are cooked \"perfectly.\"\n\nWith a sandwich like their Le Pig, a lot can go wrong: too much grease, too little grease, overly acidic pickled radishes, boring bread with the wrong texture, and so on. However, the Goodwich expertly combines various ingredients to create the perfectly balanced, yet flavorful sandwich.  It's hard to describe, but kind of like a well aged, 20-25 year old Ramon Allones Specially Selected or Partagas Lonsdale cigar, where a complex variety of rich, intense flavors complement one another in perfect harmony.  \n\nThe food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the proprietors not only know what they're doing, but are friendly and hospitable.

Ultimately considering the price point and the number of overpriced tourist traps in Las Vegas, the Goodwich may very well be one of the best restaurants in town.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2014-05-01","useful":2,"counts":{"overpriced":1,"go":1,"yet":1,"perfect":1,"le":1,",":16,"texture":1,"to":2,"only":1,"rich":1,"apart":1,"friendly":1,"sandwiches":2,"do":1,"good":1,"tourist":1,"very":2,"vegas":1,"know":1,"they":1,"not":1,"execution":1,"bread":1,"like":2,"serves":1,"reasonable":2,"where":1,"restaurants":1,"old":1,"specially":1,"be":2,"doing":1,"goodwich":3,"hard":1,"some":1,"pickled":1,"are":3,"year":1,"best":2,"really":1,"what":2,"selected":1,"overly":1,"various":1,"acidic":1,"ever":1,"considering":1,"grease":2,"complement":1,"combines":1,"ramon":1,"however":1,"hospitable":1,"intense":1,"on":1,"of":5,"place":1,"or":1,"point":1,"number":1,"one":2,"another":1,"balanced":1,"flavors":1,"little":1,"create":1,".":8,"their":1,"much":1,"too":2,"lot":1,"perfectly":2,"``":1,"that":1,"but":2,"back":1,"excellent":1,"prices":2,"with":2,"town":1,"kind":1,":":2,"this":1,"boring":1,"up":1,"20-25":1,"will":1,"'re":1,"can":1,"partagas":1,"and":5,"tasted":1,"is":2,"describe":1,"flavorful":1,"it":1,"pig":1,"''":1,"at":1,"have":1,"in":3,"aged":1,"allones":1,"ingredients":1,"food":1,"complex":1,"harmony":1,"lonsdale":1,"sandwich":2,"'s":1,"may":1,"price":1,"cigar":1,"ultimately":1,"proprietors":1,"wrong":2,"expertly":1,"las":1,"a":4,"radishes":1,"traps":1,"i":1,"variety":1,"well":2,"cooked":1,"definitely":1,"so":2,"sets":1,"the":12},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

The service was fast and it gave us a chance to eat a quick meal. The restaurant is decorated in a cute retro vibe. The employee that took our order was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. I ordered the tomato sandwich on white with cheddar. It was basically a fancy version of a grilled cheese, but it did melt in my mouth. It had an aioli sauce that was to die for, and made me want to figure out how I can re-create this delight at home. Ashley was super stoked to find out they had three types of pickled vegetables and was a little more adventurous than me with her choice of pickled watermelon. We were just back from a camping trip, so we couldn't pass up the s'mores dessert. It contains Nutella homemade graham cracker cracker crumb, and housemade marshmallow fluff. They sandwich this between two types of bread to make pure perfection. I could not ask for a better end to a tasty meal. The only reason they did not get five stars is because the area can be a little sketchy; the restroom is down an alley so be careful.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":4,"date":"2016-08-16","useful":1,"counts":{"cute":1,"just":1,"knowledgeable":1,"cheddar":1,"find":1,"re-create":1,"menu":1,"treasure":1,"had":2,",":5,"eat":1,"better":1,"to":7,"only":1,"employee":1,"sauce":1,"friendly":1,"gave":1,"get":1,"very":2,"dessert":1,"utah":1,"choice":1,"break":1,"vegas":1,"watermelon":1,"perfection":1,"they":3,"not":2,"adventurous":1,"bread":1,"fluff":1,"did":2,"die":1,"grilled":1,"meal":2,"right":1,"back":2,"pass":1,"home":1,"out":2,"reviews":1,"for":3,"nutella":1,"melt":1,"looking":1,"version":1,"retro":1,"between":1,";":1,"be":2,"we":3,"led":1,"aioli":1,"reason":1,"ask":1,"super":1,"on":2,"about":1,"her":1,"restaurant":1,"of":5,"could":2,"restroom":1,"sketchy":1,"stoked":1,"s'mores":1,"road":1,"cheese":1,"marshmallow":1,"fancy":1,"three":1,"down":1,"because":1,"little":2,"from":3,"service":1,"area":1,"vegetables":1,"contains":1,"two":1,"fast":1,".":14,"way":1,"white":1,"was":6,"more":1,"tomato":1,"homemade":1,"that":2,"took":1,"but":1,"pickled":2,"basically":1,"quick":2,"careful":1,"with":2,"than":1,"me":2,"made":1,"crumb":1,"this":4,"cracker":2,"up":1,"us":2,"n't":1,"can":2,"were":2,"my":1,"and":6,"ordered":1,"figure":1,"is":4,"in":2,"it":5,"alley":1,"an":2,"tasty":1,"at":1,"want":1,"our":1,"blvd":1,"graham":1,"trip":1,"end":1,"vibe":1,"make":1,"off":1,"how":1,"pure":1,"nice":1,"sandwich":2,"stop":1,"delight":1,"chance":1,"stars":1,"mouth":1,"decorated":1,"types":2,"las":1,"a":12,"ashley":1,"camping":1,"yelp":1,"i":3,"housemade":1,"so":2,"five":1,"the":11,"order":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":2}

I kinda like that someone comes out to talk to you, it's more personal that way.\n\nThe BF and I shared : \n\nHam & ( thick cut ham and daily inspiration which at this time was sharp cheddar, mostarda and greens). It was a nice balance of the smoky ham, the sweet mostarda chutney, the cheese, and the herbaceous bite of the eye. For $5 this is great value too. \n\nLe Pig ( pork belly, fontina, rocket, truffle vinaigrette, chip bits) I like that the pork belly has been crisp up so even the fatty bits can make a lover of someone who normally stays away from it. Again, its a nice flavor balance. Loved the buttery white pan de mie style bread.\n\nWe got some chips which is bagged chips by Tims and pickles which are homemade. Kinda reminds me of bread and butter in flavor and was really good mix of pickled cucumbers and green beans. \n\nYou can pick the bread between a white pan de mie, wheat and a marbled rye. We asked them to pick which breads were best with each instead of pick. I really say get the Ham & with rye as it adds a unexpected dimension and brings down the sweetness a little. \n\nSo this spot is so good, we came back after cigars for a snack! We shared a PBB&J on wheat. I was one of those kids who never ate PB&J and never acquired a like for them. This was a game changer for a doubter of peanut butter sandwich magic. The peanutty flavor with the red pepper, the rosemary and the bacon was awesome. I seriously went home and saw the black forest bacon waiting to be eaten in my fridge and wished I had bread and pepper jelly. \n\nTheir moniker is \"stacked rite sandwiches\" and it was indeed stacked just right. The amounts of everything is in the right balance as well as the flavor play in a stack that stays put. Simple things like sandwiches sometimes fail so bad as a \"elevated\" item, but these are successful and smart creations. Makes sense as Jake and Josh have worked haute cuisine which I found out while chatting with Jake. I figured they were experienced as there wasn't anything I could fault. The menu is just right, the prices are competitive, the friendly service and efficient cooking isn't at the level a 2 week old business is normally at....

5\/3\/16: The Sea Smoke is fantastic. The curry-vinegar chips are fantastic. I think I died and went to sandwich heaven.)\n\n(UPDATE 5\/11\/16: The Chix Fix might be the best chicken sandwich ever.)\n\nI've waited months to say these words: the Goodwich is back!\n\nToday was their official opening at the Soho Lofts, and their new place is indeed lofty. Their entrance actually faces Hoover Ave, which explains why I haven't noticed much when driving by on Las Vegas Blvd. Seating is indoor and limited, but still vastly preferable to the inside of your car or an open-air chair at the old shack.\n\nTheir old lot outside Dino's was always easy to park in, so parking at their new brick-and-mortar was one of my more immediate concerns. I was fortunate to find street parking (free 3+ hours most spots on the nearest segment of Hoover) at the end of their lunch rush because the next closest option is a $1\/hour paid lot. The street was almost empty by the end of my meal though, and Josh is trying to work with the city to allow customers validated parking. Stay tuned.\n\nThe new menu (available on their web site) has expanded in breadth and depth. In addition to sandwiches, they offer vegetarian salads (protein additional charge), several sides, and even desserts (although only the blondie and fluff 'n nut sandwich were available today). They've also added fountain drinks (and cups for water, hooray). drip coffee with beans from Henderson favorite Mothership Coffee Roasters, and \"rocket\"proof coffee (bulletproof but presumably better). They'll also implement a pretty big breakfast menu and morning hours soon (targeted for early May).\n\nThat said, sandwiches have always been my main focus, so I keyed in on two of their new options. The Hawkeye ($8.50) comes on potato bread and includes a not-too-thin slab of crispy pork as well as several condiments. I loved the bread and condiments but found the pork to be a little dry and plain. My second choice was the Cold Brown ($8.00), a temperature-twisted take on a hot brown. While I haven't ever had the latter, I really enjoyed this rendition. It has large chunks of turkey (this ain't no deli sliced meat) and thick smoky bacon but is served cold, making it delicious fresh or as a to-go option. The Cold Brown is definitely a new favorite of mine.\n\nThe inevitable price hike was definitely overdue, so I wasn't too surprised that most of their sandwiches now cost at least $1 more. But their mainstays including the Reuben-ish, Patty, and Ham& are back, as are crowd favorites such as the Falafel and BLTG. They also have a rotating \"pig o'the week\" menu slot (Cuban-esque to start). Personally, I'm looking forward to the Sea Smoke, a slightly adjusted version of my favorite from the final menu of the shack. Josh assured me that I'll love it. Oh, and their happy hour menu (daily at 3-6pm) also looks really enticing, especially with the Pate Sliders.\n\nBy the way, did I mention that they're a real restaurant now? They've kept their ubiquitous to-go bags and wrapped sandwiches, but they have circular metal trays now for dine-in customers! More importantly, the trays still come with awesome food on top of them.\n\nThe Goodwich is definitely back and here to stay. This is the start of bigger and better things for a really awesome shop that's always had excellent sandwiches and now has even more to offer.

Quite a cross section of humanity going by.\n\nThe sandwich came and it was packed nicely in a bag.  It was wrapped in paper and sealed with one of their logo stickers.  The sandwich, the foie, was very good.  It was filled with ingredients.  There's no scrimping here.  The crispy chicken skin and the almond were a nice touch for texture.  I had the sandwich Monte Cristo style and it was nicely grilled.  I also had a diet soda to go with the sandwich.\n\nThis is a good place to stop but I'm not a fan of sitting nearly on the sidewalk or in my car.

Everything on it, including the kraut and the beef is made in house, and that, that just makes it taste so much better. Mt grandma still speaks German, and we have saurkraut ceramic jugs, and several of those shavey-kraut blade-cubes. So please understand me when I say this kraut is as good as my grandmothers.\n\nThe Grilled Cheese just makes a shitty day better, and pretty much any sandwich is an easy picnic in one step. Two sandwiches, two drinks, and a wander around one of the parks in the area is an easy way to win your date night, and for the price, you can't beat it. You could get a shitty sub at smith's....or a goodwich. Is that even a question!?\n\nThe owner is quite often working, and he is a phenomenal guy. Very friendly, very real.

It's a shack on a corner...BUT, unlike the Arepas place that used to use this spot, Goodwich seems to have a great relationship with Dino's (the bar they share the parking lot with).

The best was probably the Turkey with Boursin cheese and crispy skin. Some great juicy turkey, fresh cheese, with hot grilled Rye bread! Can't beat it. Also great was the Cauliflower and the Peanut Butter. The Cauliflower was a tad messy (lots of sauce) but the crush of the crispy rice was a nice counterpoint to the veggie itself.

Maybe I ordered poorly . . . maybe they had a bad day . . . or maybe they just make a mediocre sandwich. I ordered the Cold Brown, which really sounds amazing (most of their sandwiches do sound great). But lets break this down from menu to reality: Pulled turkey = sliced turkey lunch meat; there was nothing \"pulled\" about this, except maybe from the bag. There was indeed bacon, though it was no different than what I'd get at Smith's, so I'm not sure what the big deal is. I asked for no tomato, but instead my sandwich came with a total of FOURTEEN slices of tomato. There was no guryere, but there was some random flat-leaf parsley and a rather gloppy mayo-like sauce, neither of which were listed as items. I would have asked for those to be left off too, but it probably wouldn't have made a difference. I also ordered some \"jalapeno\" chips . . . quotes used because I tasted nothing but salt. And lets not forget to mention just how absurdly greasy the sandwich was. Other folks in my group really liked their orders, and clearly The Goodwich has a following and history of rave reviews. Personally, I was thoroughly disappointed.

Goodwich is undoubtedly the best sandwich spot in Las Vegas. I have pretty high standards for sandwiches having been spoiled by Ike's in San Francisco for several years, Fricano's in Austin, and Naked City Sandwich Shop while it existed in Vegas. This place is on point!! My boyfriend decided to pull one of those \"I'm not hungry but I'll go with you\" moments, and being the bread and cheese aficionado that I am, I didn't care. Pulled up the menu on my phone and saw that first off, all sandwiches are either $3, $5, $7, or $9 (so amazing), and that I could text to order (so convenient). I decided to go with the Patty with a side of house pickles and I was NOT disappointed. We drove over to Dino's (Goodwich is inside), and got our order curbside right on time (15 minutes was the sandwich eta). I NEVER ever everrrr eat in my car but I truly could not wait another moment-- and this sandwich was unbelievable. Bread perfectly grilled, high quality ingredients, amazingly friendly sandwich man, delish side of pickles and beets-- it took all of 30 seconds before my boyfriend realized I probably wasn't going to share, and put in his order for a Falafel sandwich. Again-- superb. The location, service, and quality are top notch, and I will definitely be back!!

Goodwich the name says it all!\n\nThis place is located right in Dino's Bar's parking lot. Just a little stand with some tables and chairs. Sounds great to me! The staff really care about everything they make and put into the food. They are also super friendly and attentive. They have sandwiches ranging from $3 to $9 and you can also add stuff on if you'd like. After checking out the menu I ordered the Ruben-ish and Joel had the Patty and we shared a bag of bbq kettle chips.\n\nI love how they brought the sandwiches out all wrapped in white paper and a goodwich sticker. Very retro! Love it! Now the food. Wow! All the flavors in the Ruben melted together perfectly. Lots of meat on toasted marble rye. Joel's was oozing with cheese when he pulled it apart.

Featuring an eclectic menu ranging from $3-$9 with a dozen unique base-sandwiches and options for breads, add-ons, and \"Monte Cristo\" treatment providing ample room for customization it was after perhaps ten minutes of chatting with Jake about the metal-kiosk's surprising sourcing program (think foie from Artisanal Foods made into terrine by Goodwich staff, or house-made mostarda and spreads) that I placed my order and subsequently taking a seat in raucous Dino's where TV On The Radio and The NHL Network kept me entertained it would be just over 10 minutes before my food arrived, each option truly stunning despite a sub-$20 tab.  Opting for all sandwiches on White (Pain de Mie, actually, harkening Jake and co-owner Josh Clark's fine dining rearing) with two fried-golden the degustation began with the \"Foie &\" as a thick lacquer of unctuous terrine found balance of both taste and texture in crunchy, salted chicken skin plus slightly sweet stewed cabbage and moving next to \"Ham &\" a similar concept was presented, but entirely different with tender pork providing the brine as snappy arugula blended with fruity mostarda and aged cheese for big flavor, but a sense of refinement akin to something served on the strip at 4x the $5 price.  Clearly unable to resist dessert in such a setting, particularly when featuring golden bread and Nutella for $3.50 (the 50 cent upcharge for a visit to the fryer), it was with the sweet but subtle \"Fluff & Nutt\" that my meal concluded and as the soundtrack overhead shifted to Janis Joplin's 'Mercedes Benz,' subsequently joined by nearly every voice in the house, I couldn't help but smile and think about the early days of Cleveland's now-legendary Melt, a business and sourcing model not dissimilar to what The Goodwich is targeting, and one that has now spawned three additional locations.  Defying any thoughts of the 'simple sandwich' I wish the folks all the luck in the world and will undoubtedly be back; a $9 foie gras fix is something not even \"Major Cities\" have to offer...not to mention anything for $3 using ingredients this good.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2014-02-09","useful":8,"counts":{"monte":3,"concept":1,"particularly":1,"help":1,"cristo":3,"golden":1,"when":1,"over":1,"cheddar":1,"all":2,"mousse":1,"not":3,"brine":1,"radio":1,"skin":2,"subtle":1,"chicken":2,"still":1,"fine":1,"staff":1,"style":2,"cut":1,"20":1,"ham":3,"located":1,"tv":1,"(":5,"fix":1,"josh":1,",":26,"texture":1,"actually":1,"better":1,"to":9,"only":2,"program":1,"treatment":1,"nhl":1,"folks":1,"smile":1,"poised":1,"has":1,"artisanal":1,"then":1,"jake":3,"dissimilar":1,"ample":1,"get":1,"food":1,"dessert":1,"de":1,"truly":1,"early":1,"eclectic":1,"every":1,"nearly":1,"mention":1,"despite":1,"front":1,"world":1,"unique":1,"fryer":1,"bread":1,"stewed":1,"arugula":2,"fluff":2,"surprising":1,"presented":1,"crunchy":1,"50":1,"rearing":1,"each":1,"found":1,"entirely":1,"where":1,"meal":1,"restaurants":1,"concluded":1,"the":20,"pork":1,"gras":2,"ten":1,"be":4,"house":1,"goodwich":3,"almond":1,"back":1,"seat":1,"resist":1,"'":2,"leslie":1,"now":1,"cleveland":1,"tender":1,"'s":6,"terrine":2,"upcharge":1,"smiling":1,"even":1,"n't":1,"what":1,"said":1,"network":1,"for":8,"informative":1,"selected":1,"nutella":2,"sourcing":2,"melt":1,"voice":1,"3":1,"unable":1,"dive-bar":1,"it":4,"progress":1,";":1,"before":1,"ever":1,"can":1,"crunch":1,"house-made":1,"who":1,"lacquer":1,"business":1,"of":10,"refinement":1,"served":1,"targeting":1,"'mercedes":1,"cities":1,"by":3,"$":7,"both":1,"about":2,"providing":2,"anything":1,"items":1,"just":1,"days":1,"fruity":1,"plus":1,"3-":1,"menu":1,"arrived":1,"joplin":1,"luck":1,"slightly":1,"options":1,"cheese":1,"major":1,"clark":1,"add-ons":1,"dino":2,"sweet":2,"into":1,"trio":1,"one":1,"fried-golden":1,"blended":1,"degustation":1,"customization":1,"strip":1,"thick":2,"throughout":1,"crispy":1,"spawned":1,"foie":5,"from":2,"additional":1,"would":1,"&":6,"destination":1,"visit":2,"two":1,"cent":1,"next":1,"unctuous":1,"mostarda":3,"marshmallow":1,"snappy":1,"overhead":1,"featuring":2,":":1,"was":4,"ranging":1,"shifted":1,"``":6,"opting":1,"option":1,"chatting":1,"offer":1,"with":8,"-":3,"but":4,"joined":1,"think":2,"kept":1,"sub-":1,"undoubtedly":1,"white":1,"harkening":1,"gracious":1,"me":1,"10":1,"made":1,"room":1,"tab":1,"metal-kiosk":1,"wish":1,"work":1,"this":1,"as":4,"entertained":1,"now-legendary":1,"will":1,"placed":1,"stunning":1,"could":1,"three":1,".":5,"base-sandwiches":1,"akin":1,"balance":1,"similar":1,"taking":1,"something":2,"and":19,"flavor":1,"3.50":1,"salted":1,"...":1,"taste":1,"minutes":2,"is":3,"benz":1,"locations":1,"an":1,"''":6,"foods":1,"good":1,"at":1,"have":1,"sense":1,"my":4,"nutt":2,"aged":2,"clearly":1,"if":1,"different":1,"present":1,"ingredients":1,")":5,"began":1,"spreads":1,"mie":1,"any":1,"lounge":1,"dining":1,"that":4,"setting":1,"5":1,"sandwiches":2,"big":1,"9":2,"dozen":1,"janis":1,"toasted":1,"sandwich":1,"pain":1,"price":1,"after":1,"soundtrack":1,"raucous":1,"moving":1,"nothing":1,"such":1,"cabbage":2,"on":3,"subsequently":2,"thoughts":1,"inspiration":1,"a":13,"'simple":1,"short":1,"in":7,"self-pronounced":1,"using":1,"described":1,"i":3,"daily":1,"or":1,"perhaps":1,"time":1,"co-owner":2,"4x":1,"model":1,"breads":1,"order":1,"caramelized":1,"defying":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":7}

I'm just waiting ever so patiently for my 3 sammies to be cooked up in the tiny one-man-little-shack on the street corner. The menu is short, sweet and cheap. We actually came here for the \"Foie&\" madness, but unfortunately the Vegas summer heat had been way too harsh (the foie mousse was quickly melting inside of the quaint little shack), so they had to take it off the menu and replace it with Pate&. \n\nOne thing can be equally said about all of the sammies - the white bread that was used had delicious buttery flavor. Here's what we tried:\n\n- Pate& ($9) P\u00e2t\u00e9 de campagne, radish, rocket, piccalilli. Thick slices of soft p\u00e2t\u00e9 with lots of refreshing, crunchy radish and rocket greens. Interesting, sophisticated and playful flavors. It's not a bad choice, it just wasn't our flavor favorite. Flavor rating: 3\/5\n\n- Fried Egg ($3) Broke yolk, sea salt, & butter. It's as simple as it sounds - a fried egg sammy! It was too simple and nothing exciting. More on the disappointing side. I would recommend this one for a picky eater or a young'n! Flavor rating: 2\/5\n\n- Roasted Carrot ($5) let me first state, I'm an avid meat eater\/lover but this veggie sammy was incredible! Roasted sweet carrots with homemade house ricotta, sweet honey gastrique, crunchy pepita - so amazing! The creamy house made ricotta really tied everything together and the subtle sweetness of the honey gastrique added the extra special touch. The carrots are roasted to perfection and have a slight bite to them. The nuts added exciting texture. Not to mention it's such a vibrant and colorful sammy! Beautiful! I would order this again and again. Flavor rating: 5\/5\n\nThe shack is truly charming and I adore the newly painted robot mural - super cutesy and nerdy! The perfect pop of art and color that brightens up Vegas! \n\nThey don't really have much going on for patio seating or comfortable seating, for that matter. They are partnered up with Dino's Lounge right next door and you are encouraged to grab your sammies and head over to the bar to escape from the hot sun, the sweltering heat, grab a table, and a seat, and enjoy your Goodwich. Just make sure you don't have kids with you, it's a 21+ bar.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":4,"date":"2014-08-14","useful":10,"counts":{"summer":1,"all":1,"just":3,"rating":3,"-":7,"over":1,"cheap":1,"mousse":1,"one-man-little-shack":1,"playful":1,"roasted":3,"touch":1,"subtle":1,"flavor":5,"21+":1,"perfect":1,"avid":1,"$":3,"quaint":1,"menu":2,"slices":1,"had":3,",":22,"texture":1,"actually":1,"shack":2,"going":1,"sweltering":1,"sweet":3,"ricotta":2,"do":2,"them":1,"to":8,"colorful":1,"de":1,"choice":1,"mention":1,"vegas":3,"3\/5":1,"perfection":1,"they":3,"not":3,"one":2,"day":1,"bread":1,"melting":1,"bar":2,"meat":1,"greens":1,"vibrant":1,"crunchy":2,"''":1,"bad":1,"campagne":1,"grab":2,"soft":1,"side":1,"enjoy":1,"seating":2,"right":1,"art":1,"house":2,"goodwich":1,"hanging":1,"mural":1,"yolk":1,"sure":1,"are":3,"sea":1,"corner":2,"our":1,"thick":1,"special":1,"encouraged":1,"what":1,"said":1,"for":5,"waiting":1,"lots":1,"sun":1,"rocket":2,"eater\/lover":1,"pepita":1,"everything":1,"3":2,"young'n":1,"it":9,"hooker":1,"ever":1,"be":2,"we":2,"p\u00e2t\u00e9":2,"slight":1,"cutesy":1,"here":2,"pate":2,"exciting":2,"super":1,"2\/5":1,"on":4,"about":1,"kids":1,"newly":1,"of":6,"favorite":1,"hot":2,"thing":1,"(":4,"let":1,"sweetness":1,"or":2,"first":1,"and":16,"equally":1,"madness":1,"extra":1,"color":1,"radish":2,"veggie":1,"pop":1,"replace":1,"been":1,"delicious":1,"table":1,"sounds":1,"quickly":1,"gastrique":2,"your":2,"patiently":1,"flavors":1,"little":1,"foie":2,"from":1,"interesting":1,"would":2,"&":4,"bite":1,"tiny":1,"next":1,"creamy":1,"much":1,"too":2,"way":1,"recommend":1,"white":1,":":4,"was":5,"more":1,"a":11,"head":1,"carrots":2,"door":1,"homemade":1,"that":3,"painted":1,"buttery":1,"but":2,"charming":1,"heat":2,"state":1,"piccalilli":1,"broke":1,"seat":1,"with":5,"refreshing":1,"me":1,"disappointing":1,"made":1,"unfortunately":1,"5\/5":1,"this":3,"inside":1,"up":3,"n't":3,"matter":1,"street":2,"adore":1,"can":1,"nerdy":1,"fried":2,"my":1,"beautiful":1,"is":2,"escape":1,"``":1,"comfortable":1,"honey":2,"really":2,"as":2,"carrot":1,"have":3,"in":1,"an":1,"simple":2,"!":9,"again":2,"dino":1,"harsh":1,"no":1,")":4,"make":1,"nuts":1,"lounge":1,".":19,"amazing":1,"5":1,"take":1,"9":1,"so":3,"sammy":3,"out":1,"sophisticated":1,"added":2,"'s":6,"tried":1,"eater":1,"tied":1,"brightens":1,"nothing":1,"such":1,"'m":3,"truly":1,"butter":1,"short":1,"off":1,"picky":1,"i":6,"egg":2,"incredible":1,"sammies":3,"robot":1,"together":1,"cooked":1,"used":1,"came":1,"partnered":1,"you":3,"the":23,"salt":1,"order":1,"patio":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":5}

It is run by locals with a pedigree [check out http:\/\/dtlv.com\/2014\/01\/29\/get-ready-to-meet-and-eat-the-goodwich\/] and it is definitely a destination worth checking out.\nI had the \"deconstructed\" falafel sandwich.  You heard me right:  falafel SANDWICH, not pita pocket.  With a falafel paddy, not falafel balls, and kale slaw on marbled RYE bread.\nDefinitely not your mother's take on falafel.\nThe cons:  even though the sandwich was made to order, it was cold when it arrived and the kale slaw was runnier than I otherwise would have liked.\nThe pros: Locally owned and managed, quality ingredients, intriguing location full of local history and quintessential Las Vegas neighbors such as Olympic Gardens, Dino, Clay Arts Vegas, and the Arepas restaurants that made its reputation in the same kiosk.  And this restaurant team really cares and live in the downtown Las Vegas neighborhood.\nWhatever cons I experienced easily could be attributed to the fact that the restaurant is still sorting things out. It has not even opened yet officially.\nAnd given the ingredients and unique offerings, the prices of $3-$9 for the sandwich, is a steal!!\nI even talked with Josh about doing a community fundraiser in June, http:\/\/www.utwnow.org\/host-utw-day-party\/  ..  more on that later :)\nI am definitely a fan and I definitely will go back often!","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":4,"date":"2014-02-01","useful":0,"counts":{"neighbors":1,"concept":1,"managed":1,"kale":2,"quintessential":1,"go":1,"cold":1,"still":1,"its":1,"$":2,"mother":1,"had":1,",":15,"to":2,"location":2,"has":1,"local":1,"worth":1,"checking":1,"pocket":1,"historic":1,"fan":1,"owned":1,"not":4,"unique":2,"bread":1,"easily":1,"sorting":1,"\/\/www.utwnow.org\/host-utw-day-party\/":1,"team":1,"steal":1,"restaurants":1,"olympic":1,"\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/the-goodwich\/1375892382662303":1,"neighborhood":2,"often":1,"doing":1,"goodwich":1,"back":1,"sandwich":4,"falafel":5,"http":2,"locals":1,"out":3,"even":3,"pedigree":1,"for":1,"\/\/dtlv.com\/2014\/01\/29\/get-ready-to-meet-and-eat-the-goodwich\/":1,"pros":1,"yet":1,"officially":1,"be":1,"full":1,"run":1,"clay":1,"arts":1,"[":1,"by":1,"on":3,"about":1,"would":1,"restaurant":2,"of":2,"could":1,"attributed":1,"3-":1,"pita":1,"otherwise":1,"liked":1,"destination":1,"dino":1,"josh":1,"definitely":4,"community":1,"offerings":2,"fundraiser":1,"right":1,"quality":1,"your":1,"given":1,"..":1,"cares":1,"locally":1,".":11,"live":1,"https":1,":":7,"was":3,"more":1,"``":1,"that":3,"kiosk":1,"arepas":1,"whatever":1,"prices":1,"with":4,"than":1,"me":1,"intriguing":1,"balls":1,"this":2,"will":1,"fun":1,"history":1,"and":11,"cons":2,"slaw":2,"is":5,"am":1,"it":5,"''":1,"heard":1,"as":1,"have":1,"in":4,"made":2,"check":1,"!":4,"talked":1,"ingredients":2,")":1,"things":1,"deconstructed":1,"rye":1,"when":1,"same":1,"reputation":1,"take":1,"9":1,"you":1,"really":1,"paddy":1,"experienced":1,"'s":1,"though":1,"welcome":1,"june":1,"arrived":1,"such":1,"]":1,"opened":1,"a":8,"downtown":1,"i":6,"later":1,"marbled":1,"order":1,"runnier":1,"vegas":3,"las":2,"the":15,"gardens":1,"fact":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

So a trek this way for a sandwich must mean it's good stuff!\n\nOur first visit we got: \n\n* Foie & \"foie gras mousse, crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almond\" ($9) - Rich, decadent, messy, and oh so good.  But probably best to share this one because it's a heavy sandwich for one.\n\n* Le Pig \"belly, fontina, rocket, truffle vinagrette, chip bits\" ($9) - This has probably become one of our favorites as we've ordered this again.\n\n* PBB&J \"peanut butter, bacon, rosemary, pepper jelly\" ($5) - I haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in years.  Once you have this version, you won't be able to eat a regular PB&J sandwich again.  And bacon? Hello!\n\nSubsequent visits:\n\n* Span-ish \"chorizo, mortadello, manchego, olive, piquillo\" ($9) - Our picky eater, aka the Little Guy, was all over the mortadello!  As a result, he may never eat good old-fashioned bologna again!\n\n* Chicken \"provolone, bacon, wilted greens, tomato, ginger\" ($7) - The chicken was actually still in the roaster, so they suggested using pork belly in the sandwich instead.  Pork belly, when is it not tasty?\n\n* Grilled Cheese \"bread, american, bread\" ($3) - This was a pretty boring grilled cheese sandwich, it's literally just bread and cheese.  In retrospect, adding some bacon ($2) or foie gras ($4) probably would have taken this little sandwich to a whole new level.\n\nWhat I love about the Goodwich is that it's fast food, but not.  Sure, it takes a little while to get your sandwiches made but that's okay.  We put our orders in and pay and then the food gets run out to our car.  So, we love that.  And service - I cannot say enough things about how important great customer service is and these guys know this.  They make small talk, they recognize and appreciate return customers, and they are flexible.    \n\nAnd you can call or TEXT your orders in ahead of time!  How sweet is that?! \n\nThey had a Mushroom Melt on their very first day and haven't had it since.  I've been asking and so far no luck.  But they said that if enough people ask for it, it may show up again.  Help a girl out!

Thus far I've only found a couple: Viva Las Arepas and Art of Flavors. You can now add The Goodwich to that small list. Like many of the businesses in this area, The Goodwich is a hole-in-the-wall. It is literally a small sandwich stand and nothing else. But, damn, they do sandwiches good! The menu features 12 different sandwiches grouped into triplets by price ($3, $5, $7, or $9). \n\nI liked the variety of sandwich types. The most popular on the list were the patty and the reuben-ish. I'm always a sucker for grilled cheese sandwiches, but I ended up ordering the patty on rye bread. The patty was somewhat reminiscent of a cheesesteak sandwich, but even better. The bread was perfectly buttered and toasted and even after half an hour, the sandwich stayed toasted and hot. The ground beef with smoked cream cheese was heavenly. It seemed so basic, but all the flavors were on point. After eating here, I can't bring myself to eating sandwiches anywhere else in town. I can't wait to return to try some of the other offerings including the el pig and chicken.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2015-08-29","useful":3,"counts":{"all":1,"ended":1,"businesses":1,"chicken":1,"ground":1,"$":4,"(":1,",":11,"including":1,"better":1,"to":5,"only":1,"grilled":1,"into":1,"do":1,"good":1,"return":1,"far":1,"sucker":1,"couple":1,"12":1,"they":1,"half":1,"now":1,"bread":2,"like":1,"bring":1,"always":1,"list":2,"'ve":1,"try":1,"small":2,"found":1,"reuben-ish":1,"el":1,"art":1,"goodwich":2,"some":1,"are":1,"wander":1,"even":2,"for":1,"literally":1,"reminiscent":1,"3":1,"7":1,"heavenly":1,"seemed":1,"eating":2,"were":2,"here":1,"popular":1,"by":1,"wait":1,"on":3,"most":1,"of":6,"stand":1,"menu":1,"or":1,"patty":3,"cheese":2,"liked":1,"features":1,"point":1,"reasons":1,"ca":2,"offerings":1,"flavors":2,"beef":1,"area":1,"ordering":1,"there":1,"cheesesteak":1,"add":1,".":15,"damn":1,"too":1,"triplets":1,":":1,"was":3,"north":1,"that":1,"basic":1,"but":4,"else":2,"arepas":1,"somewhat":1,"an":1,"with":1,"viva":1,"myself":1,"perfectly":1,"hour":1,"this":1,"hole-in-the-wall":1,"up":1,"n't":3,"anywhere":1,"can":1,"many":2,"and":7,"is":2,"thus":1,"it":2,"pig":1,"stratosphere":1,"in":2,"cream":1,"!":1,"different":1,"variety":1,")":1,"buttered":1,"rye":1,"stayed":1,"grouped":1,"hot":1,"other":1,"5":1,"sandwiches":4,"9":1,"you":1,"toasted":2,"sandwich":4,"price":1,"after":2,"town":1,"nothing":1,"'m":1,"types":1,"las":1,"a":5,"i":6,"so":1,"the":18,"smoked":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":4}

My wife had their variation of the patty melt. She really liked it. The Goodwich also has some intriguing side dishes. Most appear to be natural and organic. The corn dish had 3 or so different types of kernels and was fresh and tasty. The portion size for that side was small for the price. The sandwiches though were large and a value for the price (especially in downtown Vegas). The restaurant is in a very modern, comfortable space with high ceilings. Ample seating for about 20 inside and a similar number outside. Good availability of free and low-cost parking. The staff was extremely friendly, personable, and helpful.

When I decided to visit this place with my sister, a fellow Yelper. We decided on The Goodwich based on tons of awesome reviews and word of mouth. From the moment we walked in to the very end of our lunch was simply amazing. The staff here is very friendly and worked great as a team. I do like the open kitchen with a semi-industrial look and the use of space works well for Goodwich. The option of an open patio for al fresco dinning is a plus especially whenever we have nice weather like yesterday.\n\nOn to the food, I ordered the Patty with a fried egg. From the first bite of my sandwich to end was satisfying. Each ingredient was well balanced and the ground beef was cook just right with a good amount of spices. The white bread was a perfect consistency without being dried out, too soft or soggy. My sister got the Chive Turkey and was really pleased with her order. She like the consistency and the turkey was not dried out like most places. \n\nWe got a chance to try their Fluff 'N Nut dessert sandwich. This particular item was really good and it was on point in capturing our palate. It was like a classic take on a grownup S'more with an European flair because of the Nutella. I highly recommend everyone to try this dessert out.\n\nAwesome customer service and delicious food in the Arts district of Downtown.

Very industrial-chic with exposed ac ducts and and lots of concrete.\n\nWe were there about 2:00 p.m. so it wasn't too busy (apparently they are quite a lunch destination).  The server, Will (?) was very helpful in asking us if we had any questions and explaining what some of their favorites were.  We ordered two Reben-ish, which includes house-made and cured corned beef, and one Cauliflower Goodwich, which has roasted cauliflower, sweet onion fondue, crispy rice, and curry powder.  Both were made to order and delivered cut on the diagonal and oooooooozing (let me repeat.....oooooozzzzzzzing) with cheesy goodness.  I'm surprised Instagram hasn't blown up with photos and crazy hashtags on Goodwiches.\n\nWe also ordered some house-made pickles, which were very good, plus some soda's (from a fancy Coke machine that allows you to add flavors to basic soda's like cherry, orange, lemon, etc.).\n\nAlthough you order at the the counter (it's not full service), Will came by several times to check on us.

I am totally willing to wait in line for a delicious meal, even if it means standing outside on a seedy corner on the Vegas strip. I don't mind the wait times, especially if it means quality food. However, what I do mind is the promise of said food in a time-frame that couldn't be met. Here's the deal:\n\nFriday night our party of 4 stops by the Goodwich after exploring the new Fremont street. I've been curious to stop by this place for months, having gone to the Arepa stand that used to be in its place. I've heard good things about the Fluff&Nutt and Ham sandwich with Arugula so I was excited to try the place out. What was even better was the 5-minute wait time the cashier assured me upon ordering both sandwiches and the offer to bring it to our car, all bagged up when it was ready. No one else was seemingly in line, so the prospect of eating a delicious sandwich in minutes had my mouth watering.\n\nSadly, it all went downhill from there. Ten minutes pass - no big deal. 5 minutes is no reason to get all worked up. Fifteen minutes pass - getting a little antsy. Twenty-five minutes pass - I walk up to the counter upon which the cashier is trying not to make eye-contact with me. Then, what I believe to be a random patron asks me if I've ordered yet as I'm trying to get the cashier's attention (keep in mind this is a TINY stand) and as I tell him I've already ordered and have been \"waiting for days\" he busts out with...\n\n\"We try to think of ourselves as somewhere between Jimmy Johns and In-n-Out, so all our orders are made from scratch...you'll need to be patient\"\n\nI told him that I'm ok with waiting for great food, but that I was simply irked by his employee's false promise and subsequent failure to acknowledge it. A big part of my dining experience out is the service - yes, I wasn't at a five-star restaurant but basic timing, let alone common courtesy, is not something that requires a michelin star to understand. What was worse was that he simply went back to his group of friends (employees, random customers? I don't know) standing to the side of the shop to hang out again, seemingly oblivious. No word to the cook, no mention to the cashier. Just a simple brush off as if I had come across the wrong side of the tracks.\n\nBottom line - by the time we actually received our sandwiches (which I had to come get myself despite his offer to bring it to us), I wasn't in any kind of mood to eat it. The Fluff-Nut was ok...a nice little dessert spin on the quintessential grilled-cheese, but I didn't even bother to try the Ham sandwich because of the bad taste the cashier left in my mouth. My friend said that it was good, but nothing special. \n\nKind of how I was made to feel simply trying to buy a sandwich. 2 STARS","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":2,"date":"2015-05-06","useful":3,"counts":{"shop":1,"all":4,"nutt":1,"need":1,"just":2,"scratch":1,"keep":1,"random":2,"bring":2,"jimmy":1,"quintessential":1,"corner":1,"yes":1,"trivial":1,"its":2,"dining":1,"trying":3,"group":1,"ham":2,"acknowledge":1,"somewhere":1,"(":3,"watering":1,"had":3,",":23,"actually":1,"better":1,"to":28,"window":1,"willing":1,"4":1,"my":4,"eye-contact":1,"employee":1,"5":1,"totally":1,"excited":1,"momentum":1,"outside":1,"hip":1,"do":3,"customers":1,"good":2,"worse":1,"honest":1,"means":2,"food":3,"big":2,"dope":1,"fremont":1,"myself":1,"seemingly":3,"mention":1,"vegas":1,"know":1,"promise":2,"despite":1,"not":2,"one":1,"him":2,"is":7,"cool":1,"fluff":1,"in-n-out":1,"like":1,"did":1,"'ve":4,"leave":1,"item":1,"arepa":1,"common":1,"night":1,"time-frame":1,"went":2,"side":2,"mean":1,"viola":1,"everyone":1,"deal":2,"trend":1,"goodwich":1,"some":1,"back":1,"used":1,"line":3,"street":1,"are":3,"pass":3,"our":4,"...":4,"thinks":1,"special":1,"out":5,"even":3,"n't":6,"what":4,"said":2,"mood":1,"for":5,"bottom":1,"subsequent":1,"bad":1,"stops":1,"yet":1,"when":1,"waiting":2,"between":1,"new":3,"twenty-five":1,"across":1,"?":1,"told":1,"be":4,"we":2,"friday":1,"eating":1,"c'mon":1,"assured":1,"upon":2,"attention":1,"however":1,"here":1,"met":1,"reason":1,"let":1,"alone":1,"sadly":1,"fifteen":1,"by":4,"wait":3,"thrown":1,"both":1,"about":1,"ok":2,"service":2,"efficiency":1,"fluff-nut":1,"of":13,"could":1,"months":1,"days":1,"experience":1,"meal":1,"patrons":1,"stand":2,"seedy":1,"think":1,"irked":1,"and":11,"already":1,"gone":1,"feel":1,"johns":1,"walk":1,"arugula":1,"because":1,"simply":3,"brush":1,"delicious":2,"strip":1,"ordered":2,"restaurant":1,"quality":1,"downhill":1,"standing":2,"little":2,"from":2,"ten":1,"asks":1,"&":1,"ordering":1,"come":2,"there":1,"tiny":1,".":24,"busts":1,"2":1,"stars":1,"basic":1,"politeness":1,":":1,"was":13,"tell":1,"opens":1,"bagged":1,"exploring":1,"``":1,"buy":1,"offer":2,"with":4,"am":1,"getting":1,"cashier":5,"great":1,"but":4,"else":1,"timing":1,"failure":1,"part":1,"understand":1,"oblivious":1,"off":1,"worked":1,"believe":1,"spin":1,"eat":1,"he":2,"me":3,"kind":2,"made":2,"word":1,"'s":3,"this":2,"car":1,"bother":1,"created":1,"up":4,"us":1,"reviews":1,"matter":1,"sometime":1,"friend":1,"grilled-cheese":1,"conformity":1,"employees":1,"at":1,"prospect":1,"five-star":1,"ready":1,"false":1,"patron":1,"then":1,"taste":1,"minutes":5,"foodie":1,"received":1,"mind":3,"it":9,"''":3,"heard":1,"as":4,"his":3,"something":1,"have":1,"curious":1,"cook":1,"been":2,"times":1,"orders":1,"simple":2,"if":5,"!":1,"again":1,"different":1,"'ll":1,"no":5,")":3,"things":1,"make":1,"get":3,"-":5,"ourselves":1,"how":1,"that":7,"patient":1,"sandwiches":2,"which":2,"dessert":1,"party":1,"you":1,"wonder":1,"nice":1,"sandwich":4,"star":1,"tracks":1,"any":1,"stop":1,"after":1,"hang":1,"'m":2,"wrong":1,"mouth":2,"5-minute":1,"nothing":1,"courtesy":1,"on":4,"friends":1,"michelin":1,"a":14,"antsy":1,"in":8,"especially":1,"i":24,"try":3,"counter":1,"so":3,"place":4,"components":1,"time":2,"the":32,"requires":1,"having":1,"left":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

But this little eatery is a reminder that size doesn't matter, it's what's inside (mainly the food they can make), that counts.\n\nI did the \"Patty\" (minus the pepper jack cheese and bell peppers).  Although I'm a huge fan of trying things as they are listed on the menu, I went sans pepper cheese and bell peppers on this order because I was sharing with my wife (who isn't a fan of either those things).  You know what, I can't imagine this sandwich tasting ANY better WITH pepper jack cheese or bell peppers.  The meat was ground up real good and had a nice saltiness to go with that slight sweetness coming off the grilled onions (which were plentiful, and plenty appreciated)!  Add in the \"just enough\" creaminess and slight smokiness that smoked cream cheese gave to the sandwich combined with that grilled bread and I was already wishing I had ordered another \"to go.\n\nI also ordered the \"Grill Cheese\", but did it \"Monte Cristo\" style.  They don't have a deep fryer in that little shack, so their version of the Monte Cristo is dipping the individual slices of bread in an egg wash and then grill them (kinda like a french toast). The result is thicker, fluffier bread.

This business was created by guys who used to work on the Strip at places like Aureole and Prime. They use the kitchen in Dino's next door to do most of the prep work and create just about everything from scratch except the bread and some cheeses. They even make their own peanut butter! Other items are prepped and sandwiches sold from a small stand\/kiosk several feet away from Dino's on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Wyoming street.

I like the simple setting. It's cozy enough but still plenty of room. The kitchen is decent size. After working in a food truck for so long, you don't need much room and can make it work anywhere else. There is a TV so you can watch the game. The floor is the shiny concrete style, which I like. \n\nI didn't know what to order- like usually at places. He said they added things to their menu since the food truck, which is nice. The guy was very helpful with my indecisiveness. I asked if there was anything besides beef or pork. He gave me two options, both vegetarian- the Falafel and the Tomato. I wasn't raving in my head about either but I ordered the Falafel with a side of pickled beets on the side. \n\nI ate half of my sandwich because it was filling but at the same time not something I was scarfing down my face. I realized that there was a fish option on the menu- Sea Smoke. That totally fit my request of something not beef or pork. And then I saw the Chix Fix with chicken. I wish he told me those options because I would've definitely ordered the Sea Smoke, but I couldn't get mad because I didn't look at the menu thoroughly. \n\nI noticed they forgot my side of beets with my sandwich. Luckily I didn't take my to-go order right out the door. They made it up to me and gave me a free dessert bar. That was nice of them. The beets had an interesting taste, but I probably wouldn't order it again because the portion size is really small. \n\nThe Goodwich is perfect to stop by if you're already downtown. Easy parking in front.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":4,"date":"2016-06-28","useful":0,"counts":{"things":1,"enter":1,"being":1,"soon":1,"front":1,"on":2,"chicken":1,"still":1,"perfect":1,"style":1,"fit":1,"tv":1,"interesting":1,"fix":1,"had":1,",":8,"to":8,"easy":1,"indecisiveness":1,"excited":1,"gave":2,"then":1,"them":3,"hit":1,"get":1,"food":3,"dessert":1,"watch":1,"game":1,"vegas":1,"fan":1,"know":1,"they":3,"half":1,"not":2,"now":1,"helpful":1,"bar":1,"like":3,"did":3,"'ve":1,"filling":1,"either":1,"small":1,"guy":1,"side":3,"pork":2,"because":4,"vegetarian-":1,"goodwich":3,"back":1,"sandwich":2,"sea":2,"forgot":1,"falafel":2,"out":1,"will":1,"what":1,"said":1,"for":2,"since":1,"fans":1,"anywhere":1,"hopefully":1,"probably":1,"told":1,"be":2,"cozy":1,"free":1,"besides":1,"by":1,"kitchen":1,"both":1,"about":1,"ate":1,"working":1,"anything":1,"restaurant":1,"of":7,"could":1,"smoke":2,"menu":2,"usually":1,"shiny":1,"options":2,"already":1,"simple":1,"down":1,"right":1,".":27,"size":2,"or":2,"beef":2,"decent":1,"there":3,"two":1,"long":1,"noticed":1,"their":3,"much":1,"stars":1,"brick":1,"was":8,"fish":1,"a":9,"head":1,"door":1,"option":1,"enough":1,"but":5,"pickled":1,"downtown":1,"luckily":1,"carrying":1,"with":5,"scarfing":1,"those":1,"he":3,"me":4,"made":1,"look":1,"places":1,"wish":1,"work":1,"up":1,"admire":1,"'re":1,"can":2,"mortar":1,"making":1,"my":8,"order-":1,"at":3,"and":7,"chix":1,"would":2,"ordered":2,"do":1,"taste":1,"is":6,"parking":1,"am":1,"it":6,"an":1,"n't":7,"as":1,"way":1,"something":2,"in":3,"need":1,"face":1,"saw":1,"if":2,"again":1,"floor":1,"thoroughly":1,"make":1,"that":3,"same":1,"very":1,"setting":1,"5":1,"take":1,"which":2,"so":2,"you":3,"really":1,"nice":2,"to-go":1,"added":1,"'s":1,"stop":1,"after":1,"asked":1,"mad":1,"plenty":1,"else":1,"totally":1,"las":1,"tomato":1,"realized":1,"give":1,"beets":3,"room":2,"i":20,"request":1,"menu-":1,"concrete":1,"portion":1,"definitely":1,"truck":3,"time":1,"the":20,"raving":1,"order":2},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

If you feel like you're going to be accosted here, check your meds. We can get you a nice cheese sandwich and the latest issue of Oprah magazine to read poolside at the Wynn. More Goodwich for me. \n\n     That being said, the Sea Smoke was, simply put, one of the best sandwiches I've ever jammed into my gaping maw. The texture, between the crunch of the texas toasted\/grilled  rye and crackle of the crumbled chips and the ever so satisfying yield  of the mildly intoxicating smoked white fish, was THE most perfect balance of texture I've ever experienced in a sandwich. And that's just the freakin' texture! \n      \n     I'm, admittedly, a smoked fish freak. If you put your Winston Light out in a can of Chicken Of The Sea, I'd probably pay you to eat the remains. Yeah, I know, gross. But there's your perspective. \n\n     If I had to fathom a guess, I'd say they were smoking their own here. It was fairly mild, as far as smoked fish goes, but fit in magnificently with the acid of the  \"ES Soss\" and greens and saltiness of the chips. It just went so GD well together. \n      The service was fine. The people who worked there were friendly and accommodating and seemed genuinely interested in our satisfaction with the place. \n   The ambiance was....well, shit.......we ate in the parking lot. But you know that going in, so whatever.   No complaints here. There's a couple chairs around the little sandwich hut, which suited me fine. \n     All in all, what they lack in amenities they make up for X10 in product.

My next stop here I tried the chorizo and added the chicken skin extra. It's like a muffaletta with chorizo. Today I had the Reuben with once again the chicken skin. Great version of the Reuben. My son says the ham which he has had twice is the best sandwich he's ever had. He wishes they opened a branch near where we live so we could eat here more often. I also tried the fluff and nut, which makes for a great dessert sandwich to split after you've eaten one of the other sandwiches. The staff are friendly and the owner remembers almost everyone that's eaten there when they return to eat. They have the better tasting hecho en Mexico soda made with cane sugar.

The gentleman who took my order was very reassuring that it would be a treat for me and that at $9, it was a great way for me to try it and not break the bank. I found an empty chair to eat that made me feel like I was a young student at school having my favorite sandwich at lunch.\nAs you can already tell, I LOVED it! Such a strange combination to put together but it all works. Foie gras mousse\/terrine that had a creamy texture with light earthy, almost truffle-like hints (not at all gamey), this very crispy thick chicken skin (like when you hit the crispy skin jackpot on a perfectly roasted chicken), chopped almonds, and pickled purple cabbage that made sense as a necessity to cut the richness of the foie gras, all inside a grilled crunchy white bread that scrapes the inside of your mouth a little. Creamy, crunchy, savory...I couldn't believe this taste explosion that I enjoyed with each bite to the last. Oh yes. I finished the whole thing!

They had a booth set up that was serving an awesome turkey and cream cheese sandwich with buffalo sauce.  I found their booth in the lot outside Dinos and was disappointed to find that sandwich wasn't on their regular menu. I went for a late dinner last night and this was my first visit to the new location inside Soho lofts on the ground floor.  Parking on the street was no problem but I can imagine it being at a premium on weekdays.  The open high ceiling and open kitchen give it a welcoming and spacious feel even though there are only 4 or 5 tables inside.  \n\nI ordered the bratty, made with awesome bratwurst made by local Polish food artisan Jerry from Kings Sausage (another local spot you must check out) and it was amazing.  The bread was perfectly toasted, the cheese and meat in the sandwich melted together perfectly to create an awesome texture and flavor.\n\nMy friend ordered the Patty, which is a flavorful take on a patty melt.  Pepper jack cheese and ground beef.  I had a bite and it was just as good as my bratty.  She is a big fan of beets.  As a result of course we had to try the pickled beets which were amazing as well.  They had just a bit of tanginess but not as strong as some of the store bought jars of beets.  We also tried the bread and butter pickles which were pretty tasty as well.\n\nOverall I think this place is going to be a fairly regular stop for me.  I would love it even more if they added their special buffalo turkey and cream cheese sandwich to the regular menu, but the rest of the menu is quite good.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2016-06-28","useful":0,"counts":{"serving":1,"just":2,"being":1,"rest":1,"course":1,"polish":1,"flavor":1,"find":1,"ground":2,"tables":1,"menu":3,"had":4,",":4,"texture":1,"late":1,"to":6,"only":1,"going":1,"4":1,"pretty":1,"jars":1,"sauce":1,"good":2,"premium":1,"food":1,"big":1,"overall":1,"dinos":1,"fan":1,"jack":1,"they":3,"not":1,"bit":1,"disappointed":1,"bread":2,"meat":1,"sandwich":4,"try":1,"she":1,"night":1,"found":1,"went":1,"bought":1,"tanginess":1,"set":1,"goodwich":1,"some":1,"we":2,"street":1,"booth":2,"parking":1,"pickles":1,"special":1,"out":1,"even":2,"sausage":1,"for":2,"melt":1,"outside":1,"it":5,"new":1,"lofts":1,"be":1,"pepper":1,"quite":1,"imagine":1,"strong":1,"by":1,"kitchen":1,"on":5,"last":1,"beef":1,"bratty":2,"of":7,"dinner":1,"place":1,"(":1,"or":1,"first":2,"cheese":4,"love":1,"can":1,"feel":1,"another":1,"kings":1,"open":2,"turkey":2,"spacious":1,"from":1,"would":1,"tasting":1,"create":1,"there":1,"visit":1,"weekdays":1,".":17,"their":3,"beer":1,"lot":1,"perfectly":2,"was":8,"awesome":3,"store":1,"location":1,"a":12,"ceiling":1,"that":2,"bite":1,"but":3,"pickled":1,"downtown":1,"bratwurst":1,"with":2,"must":1,"me":1,"made":2,"welcoming":1,"this":2,"local":2,"inside":2,"up":1,"n't":1,"melted":1,"friend":1,"were":2,"problem":1,"more":1,"my":3,"are":1,"and":12,"ordered":2,"give":1,"is":4,"flavorful":1,"artisan":1,"an":2,"high":1,"heard":1,"as":7,"tasty":1,"at":2,"in":2,"check":1,"cream":2,"result":1,"no":1,")":1,"jerry":1,"also":1,"amazing":2,"5":1,"take":1,"which":3,"you":1,"if":1,"toasted":1,"fairly":1,"added":1,"tried":1,"though":1,"stop":1,"spot":1,"regular":3,"butter":1,"beets":3,"i":8,"floor":1,"well":2,"together":1,"think":1,"soho":1,"the":17,"patty":2,"buffalo":2},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

It's the newest place which has taken over the kiosk that used to sell arepas. Yes that little shack right in front of Dino's Lounge. \"The Foie\" with foie gras mousse was absolutely divine! I'm still drooling over it! \n \nThey sell a variety of sandwiches all made from scratch, quality ingredients, from good ol comfort food grilled cheese, corned beef made in house to gourmet ones with Foie gras.  The menu consists of 3 different sandwiches in each of the prices points of $3,5,7 & 9 dollars. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-goodwich-las-vegas?select=mErnsRlLQ-9ayHB7-iUMvA#mErnsRlLQ-9ayHB7-iUMvA  For THREE DOLLARS you  get your choice of a grilled cheese, fried egg or a nutella sandwich. THREE DOLLARS!!!  You can also add a fried egg, bacon, crispy chicken skin, foie gras and make it your own style for a nominal charge. It's a regular sized sammie as well. So it's pretty filling. \n \nLove the textures and nice flavors going on with \"The Foie\" It had a whipped Foie Gras mousse spread, almonds. There subtle sweetness to it...I think raisins or some kind of fig jam?...  It was also layered with crispy chicken skin and cabbage. Toasted Rye bread was my choice for this gourmet sandwich. Like I said it was so good. Worth the nine bucks to me.\n \nThe guys who own and run the place are cool. We met Jake. He took our orders. Cool that he already is recognizing his returning customers. Shout out to the guy who made the sandwiches. They are delicious!  Oh also if you have the foie gras sandwich, it goes great with the Rose gelato over at Art of Flavors!\n\nHeads up: they take both cards and cash. They're open late (1am!!!) on some nights now. It's a food stand so no dining area except for the few stylish white chairs and stools for seating. So it's basically take and go kinda spot. There is parking available since they share the same parking lot with Dino's. They mention on the menu you can call or text your order in advance.  Im so doing that  just to make sure I get the Foie, because I know that's going to be one of the hottest sandwiches and it's  gonna fly out that window!","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2014-02-08","useful":15,"counts":{"all":1,"comfort":1,"newest":1,"just":1,"select=mernsrllq-9ayhb7-iumva":1,"scratch":1,"over":4,"``":2,"mousse":2,"corned":1,"own":2,"drooling":1,"skin":2,"go":1,"subtle":1,"yes":1,"still":1,"to":8,"style":1,"$":1,"also":3,"menu":2,"had":1,",":10,"late":1,"shack":1,"window":1,"going":2,"almonds":1,"fig":1,"pretty":1,"text":1,"has":1,"worth":1,"ta":1,"...":2,"customers":1,"good":2,"rose":1,"get":2,"food":2,"stools":1,"choice":2,"mention":1,"jake":1,"ones":1,"know":1,"they":6,"front":1,"now":1,"you":5,"bread":1,"like":1,"chairs":1,"cool":2,"gras":5,"sized":1,"filling":1,"?":2,"each":1,"grilled":2,"stylish":1,"guy":1,"textures":1,"seating":1,"right":1,"art":1,"absolutely":1,"house":1,"goodwich":1,"bacon":1,"mernsrllq-9ayhb7-iumva":1,"sammie":1,"up":1,"consists":1,"sandwich":3,"are":2,"parking":2,"3,5,7":1,"divine":1,"chicken":2,"out":2,"#":1,"said":1,"for":5,"quality":1,"since":1,"nutella":1,"3":1,"nominal":1,"goes":1,"got":1,"except":1,"whipped":1,"can":2,"available":1,"be":1,"we":1,"run":1,"1am":1,"from":2,"returning":1,"regular":1,"both":1,"great":1,"ol":1,"met":1,"of":9,"dollars":3,"&":1,"'s":9,"layered":1,"place":2,"stand":1,"(":1,"sweetness":1,"or":3,"cheese":2,"already":1,"love":1,"dino":2,"one":1,"shout":1,"delicious":1,"crispy":2,"your":3,"spread":1,"flavors":2,"little":1,"charge":1,"heads":1,"beef":1,"area":1,"gourmet":2,"there":2,"add":1,".":24,"doing":1,"jam":1,"call":1,"lot":1,"taken":1,"white":1,":":2,"was":4,"head":1,"advance":1,"some":2,"raisins":1,"kiosk":1,"took":1,"it":13,"arepas":1,"because":1,"basically":1,"prices":1,"with":6,"hottest":1,"he":2,"me":1,"kind":1,"made":3,"this":1,"oh":1,"cash":1,"i":5,"'re":1,"nine":1,"three":2,"foie":8,"cards":1,"fried":2,"my":1,"recognizing":1,"and":8,"is":2,"share":1,"few":1,"''":2,"fly":1,"as":1,"his":1,"im":1,"at":1,"have":1,"in":4,"bucks":1,"orders":1,"if":1,"!":12,"different":1,"nights":1,"open":1,"no":1,")":1,"na":1,"make":2,"rye":1,"same":1,"\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-goodwich-las-vegas":1,"lounge":1,"dining":1,"that":6,"take":2,"which":1,"9":1,"so":5,"sandwiches":4,"toasted":1,"nice":1,"sell":2,"sure":1,"http":1,"our":1,"who":2,"spot":1,"'m":1,"gon":1,"kinda":1,"cabbage":1,"on":4,"guys":1,"a":8,"gelato":1,"variety":1,"well":1,"think":1,"points":1,"used":1,"ingredients":1,"the":20,"egg":2,"order":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":8}

It took me a few months to finally try one of their gourmet sandwiches and it makes me a little sad to know that I got to miss out on the sandwiches they had during their first 10 months, BUT I look forward to seeing what new sandwiches will be whipped up just around the corner.\n\nSo far I've had the Pulled Squash, the Radish, Fluff & Nut (Monte Cristo Style), & the Fried Egg (all on rye, minus the Fluff & Nut). The Pulled Squash has been removed from the menu since they change a few sandwiches out every two-three months and it has been replaced with the Radish. Even though I loved the Pulled Squash, the Radish has also become a regular veggie favorite of mine. Sometimes the butter can become a little overwhelming and taste a bit too salty, so proceed with caution if you don't enjoy a little too much salty taste!\n\nFluff & Nut monte cristo style on white has become one of my favorite go-to desserts and I always catch myself craving it again and again. Nutella, homemade marshmallow fluff, and crunchy bites? I need to figure out how to make it myself since I'm going to go broke from always buying it! But yes, get it monte cristo style. Trust.\n\nFrom what I remember, the fried egg wasn't anything too spectacular for me. It's been a few weeks since I tried it out, but I remember telling myself that I probably wouldn't get again since there are other sandwiches that are really unique and packed with their own flavor.\n\nTo make things more efficient, I suggest texting their number listed on the page to get your order in ahead of time. Sandwiches usually have a prep time of 8-15 minutes depending on what you get, but it's definitely worth the wait! I don't usually eat at the location since it's a little corner spot with limited amount of seating, so I always get mine to go. Every order is put in a bag, so you don't have to ask to get it to go!

Operating out of the stand that used to house Viva Las Arepas in the parking lot of Dino's this little stand makes excellent sandwiches. Their menu consists of four different prices $3,5,7 or $9. We shared the Le Pig and Foie&. Both were excellent. The Le Pig had bacon belly and butt, ginger, aioli, and some sort of pickled tapanade - it was rich but also had a lot of spring flavors which were refreshing and fulfilling.  I had it on rye bread, the rye wasn't a great match and was a little overpowering so I think if I were to get it again I would have it on white or wheat. The Foie& was well rich, as to be expected with a foie pate, and hot with the foie melting out of the sandwich - it would have gone well with a glass of wine. It was recommended that the Foie come on white bread, which makes sense considered it is common to serve foie with white toast points. The crispy chicken skin added a nice texture contrast.  Both sandwiches were $9 each but well worth it. The person taking our order was very friendly and came and checked on us while we sat in our car and ate our sandwiches. Also ordered the $2 house made pickles, they were sweet pickles and I really liked them but it is a small portion size for $2 and they come sliced. If I were to guess maybe a 2 oz portion so I don't think I would order those again. I would suggest that they move their menu up higher as it sits on the ground right now and I couldn't read it until I was up front as customers in line kept blocking the menu and I don't think I will be frequenting this spot, unless I get it to go, in the summer considering the heat. Also, note I attempted to walk over to the Art of Flavor after wards to top off my lunch but they are closed on Mondays.\n\nAlso, I just read Rod U.' s review, I agree this is not in the same category as Katz's or Carnegie but I think they are doing very well for a little shack that just opened in a town that isn't known for sandwiches. Also, I think it is foie - I have had a lot of foie and foie pate in my life (don't tell PETA) and it tasted like foie and not chicken liver to me. Also, I have had plenty of foie which have a mineral flavor to it, the iron as in any liver will tend to lend a mineral quality, if you do not soak the foie long enough while preparing a pate then a mineral flavor will remain so I do not agree that alone is indicative of it not being foie gras pate.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":4,"date":"2014-04-04","useful":3,"counts":{"summer":1,"katz":1,"rye":2,"just":2,"being":1,"over":1,"move":1,"rod":1,"named":1,"four":1,"not":5,"skin":1,"go":1,"chicken":2,"ground":1,"toast":1,"le":2,"$":5,"menu":3,"greatwich":1,"had":5,",":17,"tapanade":1,"should":1,"to":12,"stand":2,"rich":2,"worth":1,"match":1,"sandwiches":4,"do":5,"them":1,"get":2,"very":2,"could":1,"lunch":1,"overpowering":1,"indicative":1,"preparing":1,"they":5,"front":1,"now":1,"bread":2,"melting":1,"like":1,"gras":1,"this":3,"common":1,"each":1,"small":1,"nice":1,"viva":1,"right":1,"art":1,"doing":1,"house":2,"goodwich":1,"bacon":1,"pickled":1,"used":1,"consists":1,"butt":1,"added":1,"are":2,"parking":1,"wheat":1,"pickles":2,"flavor":3,"out":2,"category":1,"n't":6,"peta":1,"opened":1,"'":1,"crispy":1,"review":1,"while":2,"tend":1,"enough":1,"closed":1,"shared":1,"refreshing":1,"contrast":1,"be":3,"we":2,"3,5,7":1,"little":3,"aioli":1,"operating":1,"alone":1,"come":2,"both":2,"great":1,"ate":1,"of":11,"taking":1,"friendly":1,"hot":1,"s":1,"oz":1,"(":1,"pate":4,"makes":2,"think":5,"considering":1,"frequenting":1,"liked":1,"sat":1,"dino":1,"sweet":1,"walk":1,"sliced":1,"texture":1,"quality":1,"size":1,"flavors":1,"guess":1,"checked":1,"would":4,"&":2,"top":1,"long":1,".":20,"their":2,"2":3,"mondays":1,"lot":3,"spring":1,"expected":1,"white":3,"was":7,"tell":1,"sort":1,"a":15,"life":1,"on":6,"some":1,"serve":1,"but":5,"it":16,"arepas":1,"glass":1,"heat":1,"liver":2,"excellent":2,"prices":1,"kept":1,"line":1,"with":4,"blocking":1,"those":1,"mineral":3,"me":1,"made":1,"fulfilling":1,"car":1,"up":2,"us":1,"until":1,"will":3,"i":22,"remain":1,"iron":1,"were":6,"my":2,"agree":2,"and":16,"gone":1,"ordered":1,"shack":1,"then":1,"well":4,"is":6,"in":8,"customers":1,"ginger":1,"pig":2,"as":5,"have":5,"sense":1,"sits":1,"any":1,"if":3,"again":2,"different":1,"soak":1,")":1,"suggest":1,"that":6,"-":3,"same":1,"note":1,"also":6,"recommended":1,"read":2,"belly":1,"which":3,"attempted":1,"9":2,"so":3,"you":1,"really":1,"higher":1,"sandwich":1,"'s":2,"lend":1,"our":3,"after":1,"spot":1,"carnegie":1,"town":1,"plenty":1,"foie":13,"unless":1,"las":1,"known":1,"off":1,"for":3,"considered":1,"maybe":1,"wards":1,"or":3,"person":1,"portion":2,"points":1,"u":1,"tasted":1,"the":22,"order":2,"came":1,"wine":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":4}

Other reviewers have gone over their location so I want to focus on how fantastic their food and service really is. First off you can call and order and they will bring it to your car. Jake has been there each time I've gone and you can see how busy he is yet he's still very personable!  I love seeing the effort he puts in! Having great service adds to any dining experience so they've already won half the battle. Now the food, I've tried Le Pig, the Spanish, the Foie, and fluff and nut. \n\nLe Pig- my favorite sandwich! It has beautiful chunks of tender pork belly, arugula dressed in a truffled vinegarette, and fontina cheese. This sandwich is fan-freaking-tastic!!! The flavors of the rich pork belly cut by the dressed arugula makes a symphony in my mouth. \n \nFoie&- foie gras mousse, crispy chicken skin, caramelized cabbage, and almonds. This sandwich has flavors that I would have never thought would work, but WOW the smooth mousse with the crunchy almond are great together. \n\nFluff & Nut- this sandwich put a huge smile on my face as soon as I unwrapped it. Gooey marshmallow oozing out of the monte Cristo style white bread. I am still perplexed as to what the crunch is because it was crunchy till the last bite. I ate my Le Pig first and it was still crunchy!!!! \n\nOn my last visit I had the luck of trying their house err stand?  Made pickles and they were fresh,  sweet,  spicy,  and crisp.

Many favorites have been faithfully brought back on the menu with a few surprising new flavors.\n\nExpect to see the Cuban-esque have lasting fame as well as the Ham'&, but also welcome new tastes such as the Hawkeye which is a gigant\u00e9 crisp pork cutlet served with a tangy specialty ketchup & mustard on a bun rather than the goodwich ol' toast.

It's a little snack shack in the Dino's parking lot.  It's where Viva Arepas used to be before they moved into a shop down the street.  Your scenery is the OG across the street and the black asphalt of the parking lot, but sitting on the corner of LV Blvd and Wyoming at no thang when you're grubbing on delicious sandwiches.  You might also witness an almost-car accident like we did, which was exciting.\n\nFirst off, the guy who is running things at this place is super handsome and charming and friendly.  He chatted with my husband and I as we waited for our food and told us the story of how he and his friend came up with this idea and how they make everything in the kitchen behind Dinos.  He is so nice and earnest, that I just want to hug him.\n\nFortunately, the food speaks for itself and is a testament to their vision.  My husand got the Patty ($7), and it was a delightfully greasy, gooey, slightly spicy treat.  I got the Ham &.... which had mostarda on it to make it slightly sweet along with a cheddar cheese (I think it was cheddar...doesn't matter what it was, it was good).  It was grilled and flavorful.  And it was only $5.  Yup, $5.\n\nWe wanted to try the pickles, but they were sold out after a successful and busy Saturday.  They're new, so still trying to work out their supply and demand, so hopefully I can try those the next time I go.  Which I will.  Multiple times.

With an ever changing menu and a great price point this place has the potential to be a staple in the new Las Vegas culture.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2014-05-14","useful":3,"counts":{"mom":2,"just":1,"over":1,"well..wish":1,"gauge":1,"earth":1,"flavor":1,"find":1,"peanut":2,"had":1,",":7,"to":6,"potential":1,"easy":1,"has":2,"...":9,"good":1,"food":4,"dope":1,"overall":1,"fat":1,"vegas":1,"know":1,"they":2,"probably":1,"not":1,"bomb.com":1,"bit":1,"unique":1,"gushing":1,"cooks":1,"meat":1,"try":1,"this":4,"pbb":2,"works":1,"where":1,"restaurants":1,"everyone":1,"be":2,"goodwich":1,"hard":1,"some":4,"yolk":1,"burger":1,"second":1,"are":1,"parking":1,"chicken":1,"out":3,"stands":2,"for":2,"pictures":1,"its":1,"3":2,"passion":1,"(":1,"new":2,";":1,"ever":2,"ass":1,"crunch":1,"were":2,"however":1,"pate":2,"put":1,"by":1,"dobe":1,"on":2,"great":1,"ate":2,"your":2,"working":2,"cow":1,"herbs":1,"1842":1,"favorite":2,"jelly":1,"experience":1,"changing":2,"strange":1,"ish":1,"place":3,"stand":1,"menu":4,"usually":2,"spices":1,"or":1,"comes":1,"love":1,"point":1,"simple":1,"dudes":1,"one":1,"down":1,"done":1,"duck":1,"foodie":1,"quality":1,"staple":1,"destinations":1,"city":1,"little":1,"would":3,"&":4,"top":1,"two":1,"been":1,".":7,"strip":1,"their":1,"damn":1,"lot":2,"basic":1,":":3,"was":2,"a":7,"north":1,"that":2,"started":1,"bacon":1,"but":2,"wish":1,"reminds":2,"patte":1,"corner":1,"with":5,"me":2,"culture":1,"tang":1,"type":1,"j":2,"up":1,"can":2,"of":11,"growing":1,"fried":2,"similar":1,"stratosphere":1,"at":2,"and":8,"crack..":1,"geese":1,"taste":1,"is":4,"it":2,"an":1,"f'n":1,"something":1,"have":2,"in":6,"my":2,"work":1,"any":1,"as":3,"gone":1,".surprisingly":1,"sounding":2,")":1,"make":1,"how":1,"parts":1,"sandwiches":2,"eclectic":1,"you":4,"sandwich":1,"'s":1,"price":1,"most":1,"sandwhich":2,"mystery":1,"herby":1,"las":1,"butter":2,"refreshing":1,"i":4,"well":1,"very":2,"the":16,"egg":3,"order":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

He tried numerous times to get me to go when they were just a stand on the corner. However, I didn't make it there until they opened in their current location. \nUpon entering you good a very welcoming vibe from everybody in the shop. Everyone that work there is so friendly and checked on my friend and I to see how we were enjoying our meal. I really like most of the decor, it is unique and fits the business\n The first time I came in, I ordered The Patty.. wholly deliciousness. This sandwich was just so good. Cheesy gooey goodness. I could totally see how this is their most popular sandwich. \nThe second time I came in I ordered the Rueben-ish. I wasn't a fan of this sandwich. I felt the balance between kraut and meat and sauce was off. I could taste more of the 1000 sauce than I could of the meat and kraut. \nThe third time I came in I had the Ham&... wholly deliciousness again.. this sandwich is soo good, perfectly balanced..the mostarda on it just gives it this flavor the is beyond words.. by far my favorite right up there with the Patty. \nThe fourth time I came in I had the BLTG. I wasn't a fan of this sandwich much either. This was my first time having grits and I didn't particularly like them, I felt they kinda took away from the overall flavor of the sandwich... but this is a personal thing as my friend loved the sandwich. \nI will be back  as I am slowly working my way through trying each sandwich on the menu.

It's a Rice Krispy bar made with some sort of homemade marshmallow cream (because there is NO WAY the flavor comes out that well with store bought crap), topped with melted chocolate, toasted coconut, and bottomed out with a buttery homemade graham cracker crust. WOW. Worth every penny!\n\nAnd the ultimate to my five-star Goodwich love? THE OUTSIDE GUY. I'm madly in love with him.

The new spot is clean, modern, and full of tasty goodness. \n\nIts hard to get away from the classics like the Patty, the BLTG, and that yummy Ham sandwich. But i recently tried the Falafel and the Tomato which were good but ill be looking for something new the next time around. The Falafel was refreshing and healthy-like but the flavor would get old quick for me if i had too much of it. And the Tomato is a good \"light\" sandwich and to be expected, but am i wrong to desire something a little more in it? When i eat the Patty i feel sad to take the last bite, and that's how i know its a winner with me. Next time ill venture into a Chix-Fix or  Reuben-ish in hopes of finding another heavy weight contender. \n\nWho doesn't like food stuffed between two pieces of bread?! Goodwich and their combinations and fresh ingredients have always been a winner since the beginning for me. Now in a nice, clean location, an expended menu (breakfast), and even some coffee options you are now gonna get tired of seeing me way too often. \n\nA few things to note... \n- Im not sure why your address isn't updated on Yelp yet, but you may want to do that for people using the Yelp app and aren't aware of the new location. \n- For the love of god bring back the Corn Sandwich when the season comes around please. \n- I would cry tears of joy if you would get the bread pudding from Slo-Boy here to make my dining experience complete in once place.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2016-05-02","useful":2,"counts":{"just":1,"being":1,"when":2,"combinations":1,"chix-fix":1,"flavor":1,"its":2,"upgrade":1,"yummy":1,"ham":1,"how":1,"(":1,"winner":2,"had":1,",":10,"to":7,"only":1,"location":3,"into":1,"...":2,"updated":1,"good":2,"around":2,"get":4,"food":1,"cranky":1,"know":1,"new":4,"not":3,"using":1,"now":2,"bread":2,"desire":1,"like":2,"inviting":1,"bring":1,"always":1,"cry":1,"sandwich":3,"quick":1,"reuben-ish":1,"heavy":1,"olympic":1,"because":1,"old":1,"often":1,"weight":1,"tired":1,"goodwich":1,"hard":1,"some":1,"back":2,"street":1,"are":2,"sad":1,"falafel":2,"even":1,"gon":1,"for":5,"god":1,"away":1,"since":1,"please":1,"bltg":1,"looking":1,"waiting":1,"does":1,"between":1,"it":2,"wich":1,"across":1,"?":2,"be":2,"full":1,"recently":1,"joy":1,"corn":1,"here":1,"address":1,"beginning":1,"on":1,"last":1,"getting":1,"of":8,"ill":2,"experience":1,"sketchy":1,"pudding":1,"menu":1,"classics":1,"or":1,"comes":1,"patty":2,"seeing":1,"love":1,"thankfully":1,"feel":1,"app":1,"contender":1,"healthy-like":1,"slo-boy":1,"two":1,"another":1,"next":2,"your":1,"little":1,"from":4,"would":3,"their":1,"bite":1,"people":1,"tears":1,"been":1,".":13,"few":1,"much":1,"too":2,"stuffed":1,"time":2,"expected":1,"was":3,"more":1,"tomato":2,"``":1,"complete":1,"that":3,"season":1,"but":6,"aware":1,"hopes":1,"pieces":1,"with":1,"eat":1,"me":4,"n't":3,"venture":1,"were":1,"tasty":1,"my":1,"slightest":1,"and":12,"goodness":1,"do":1,"is":5,"modern":1,"am":1,"coffee":1,"an":1,"''":1,"way":1,"im":1,"something":2,"have":1,"in":5,"breakfast":1,"yet":1,"garden":1,"!":1,"huge":1,"want":1,"ingredients":1,")":1,"things":1,"make":1,"-":3,"who":1,"note":1,"dining":1,"take":1,"which":2,"finding":1,"place":1,"you":3,"if":2,"nice":1,"sure":1,"'s":1,"tried":1,"may":1,"expended":1,"spot":1,"wrong":1,"why":1,"a":8,"refreshing":1,"yelp":2,"i":8,"light":1,"options":1,"clean":2,"na":1,"fresh":1,"the":23,"once":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":1}

I really think it all started with the OG.  Then, everyone followed:  the lounge, the arepas place, the gelato place, and now this sandwich stand right on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Wyoming.  The Goodwich just opened so it's brand-spanking new, but word travels fast in our little town about everything and everyone, so I wanted to try this place out after hearing, yes, good things about it.  The menu is simple, with sandwiches that start from $3 (grilled cheese, fried egg) and go up to $9 (foie gras, pork belly).  Your bread choices are white, wheat, or rye, there are add-ons available for an extra charge (bacon, cheese, fried egg, foie gras, CRISPY CHICKEN SKIN) and you can \"Monte Cristo\" your sandwich for only $.50; that is, the sandwich is dipped in egg batter and then placed on the grill. \nStill kind of full from a late breakfast, I kept things simple with the grilled cheese on rye done Monte Cristo style since I've never had a sandwich prepared that way. With a bottle of water, my order came to a cheap $4.86.   Jake, the personable co-owner who looks just like Clark Kent, took our orders while his business partner manned the kitchen inside the stand.  I was there with a group of Yelp friends and as we waited for our orders on the corner in the sun, I noticed that there is quite a lot of foot traffic in that area.  There are several seats and business was brisk for a new place.  Our orders came out shortly and everyone loved their Goodwiches.  \nI usually visit the gelato place every Friday afternoon for my fix with friends; I think the Friday Food crew has found a perfect complement in the Goodwich.

Two year later, it's now a full sit down restaurant with a much larger menu, but the same deliciousness and friendly service.\n\nWhile memories of the original Reuben (still around), Le Pig, and the Foie Gras sandwiches still dancing through my head, the new menu had plenty of great options. One of those choices is the Pig of the Week, the 808 sandwich, paying homage to Hawaii. Mission accomplished!\n\nThe 808 is one of the tastiest sandwiches I have ever experienced. It starts with that great thick cut white bread toasted to perfection. Then, once the flavors hits your mouth, you will immediately sense the hint of heat from the shishito peppers and the sweetness from the eel sauce.  As you chew, the richness and tenderness of the pork shines through, along with that fluffy omelette. Oh how I wish Goodwich was in NYC AND NOT las Vegas.\n\nI also had a Tomato Soup with Green Coconut Curry. It was absolutely outstanding. Creamy and zesty, combined with the earthy sweetness from the curry, made this soup an excellent complement to my sandwich. Unfortunately, my stomach could not do more, as they offer many more mouth watering selections.

Oh and they charge $0.35 to use a credit card (3) Value: the reuben could have used a little more meat but other than that it's not cost:quality ratio is reasonable (4).\n\nWe stopped by the Goodwich after going on a bit of food sampling at a few places.\n\nI opted for the Reuben-ish and the Hubs ordered the Foie&. Both sammy's were $9 and there was a $0.35 service charge for using a credit card.\n\nLet me get this straight - you need to eat these sandwiches immediately.Even though the hubs wanted to leave due to the obvious lack of facilities (there's no tables, restrooms - it's essentially a food stall), I put my foot down on this one. A grilled hot sandwich needs to be eaten while the bread is still crunchy\/warm off the grill and the cheese is still in its semi-molten state.\n\nThe foie gras was good. A nice thick layer of foie gras mousse deliciousness, the chicken skin, cabbage, and almond created a interesting blend of flavours that really worked well together. My only criticism is that this sandwich is really rich - you'll need at least 2 people to finish this delight. The hubs wished that the mousse was a little more warm because it was a little odd to have a cold layer in this otherwise toasty sandwich. However, I disagreed - mostly because if you heat up a liver mousse it would leave an odd potential curdled texture. The only way that would work is if you used a solid piece of foie and sear it. We agreed to disagree on that point.\n\nThe Reuben was great. Loved the fennel with the mild anise flavor in lieu of straight up cabbage - this marries well with beef in general. The 1000 island dressing had a nice tang with the perfect amount in there. The melty swiss min combination with the perfectly toasted bread made this a very interesting textural dish. That being said, the only criticism I have of this sandwich was the it was a little light on the corned beef. It definitely needs a little more meat in there to make a total kick ass Reuben. Considering the amount of meat in there, $9 seemed a bit pricey to the hubs.\n\nThe bread they use is great - it's Bon Bread white, whole wheat or marble rye. The only thing that would make this list of options better is if they offered Bon Bread's amazing brioche. Why? because brioche rocks my world. And there's nothing quite like the lightly sweet egg-ish bread going with foie gras. But hey! that's just me. (I also know that a loaf of the brioche is pricey too.)\n\nFor their delicious innovative take on classic sandwiches, this joint gets a 4 starred review.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":4,"date":"2014-03-26","useful":3,"counts":{"melty":1,"just":1,"being":1,"agreed":1,"lack":1,"hot":1,"mousse":3,"restrooms":2,"combinations":1,"fennel":1,"skin":1,"dish":1,"chicken":1,"still":2,"its":1,"down":1,"seemed":1,"perfect":1,"tables":2,"ratio":1,"$":4,"(":5,"had":1,",":11,"texture":1,"than":1,"better":1,"to":10,"charge":2,"going":2,"4":3,"rich":1,"dressing":1,"that":10,"kick":1,"sandwiches":2,"good":1,"wished":1,"combination":1,"get":1,"food":2,"could":1,"credit":2,"joint":1,"know":1,"they":3,"not":1,"using":1,"bit":2,"corned":1,"you":4,"bread":6,"tang":1,"cold":1,"like":1,"facilities":1,"gras":3,"list":1,"mild":1,"rocks":1,"leave":2,"these":1,"stopped":1,"reasonable":1,"grilled":1,"starred":1,"marries":1,"reuben-ish":1,"because":3,"cost":1,"people":1,"sear":1,"goodwich":1,"almond":1,"used":2,"flavours":1,"sandwich":6,"delight":1,"value":1,"odd":2,"flavor":1,"really":2,"said":1,"opted":1,"for":3,"review":1,"deliciousness":1,"swiss":1,"3":1,"new":1,"egg-ish":1,"options":1,"?":1,"ass":1,"be":1,"we":2,"after":1,"wheat":1,"state":1,"perfectly":1,"were":1,"however":1,"quite":1,"let":1,"put":1,"wanted":1,"skinny":1,"by":1,"card":2,"both":1,"essentially":1,"service":3,"world":1,"oh":1,"island":1,"0.35":2,"grill":1,"thing":1,"amount":2,"stand":1,"bon":2,"interesting":2,"whole":1,"or":1,"otherwise":1,"criticism":2,"cheese":1,"loaf":1,"there":8,"point":1,"sweet":1,"one":1,"crunchy\/warm":1,"delicious":1,"lieu":1,"thick":1,"total":1,"quality":1,"considering":1,"little":5,"i":5,"would":3,"&":1,"gourmet":1,"anise":1,"due":1,"least":1,".":28,"sampling":1,"few":1,"2":1,"too":1,"way":1,"white":1,":":4,"was":7,"more":3,"only":4,"mostly":1,"on":5,"offered":1,"great":2,"but":2,"heat":1,"warm":1,"liver":1,"worked":1,"an":1,"with":6,"eat":1,"me":2,"loved":1,"made":1,"reuben":3,"places":1,"solid":1,"straight":2,"created":1,"this":10,"up":2,"curdled":1,"other":1,"semi-molten":1,"while":1,"stall":1,"obvious":1,"disagreed":1,"of":10,"hubs":4,"piece":1,"my":3,"marble":1,"and":8,"layer":2,"counter":1,"ordered":1,"lightly":1,"classic":2,"is":9,"it":9,"general":1,"twist":1,"at":2,"have":3,"in":7,"need":2,"work":1,"immediately.even":1,"their":1,"if":3,"!":1,"needs":2,"beef":2,"'ll":1,"min":1,")":5,"make":2,"rye":1,"-":7,"also":1,"amazing":1,"potential":1,"take":1,"9":2,"sammy":1,"gets":1,"toasted":1,"nice":2,"finish":1,"'s":11,"hey":1,"though":1,"innovative":1,"use":2,"disagree":1,"toasty":1,"brioche":3,"textural":1,"eaten":1,"nothing":1,"cabbage":2,"foie":5,"why":1,"a":24,"off":1,"foot":1,"light":1,"no":3,"well":2,"pricey":2,"together":1,"meat":3,"definitely":1,"very":1,"the":32,"1000":1,"blend":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":2}

This is an outdoor stall, almost like a food truck, so seating is very limited.  TIP: Enjoy a Goodwich inside Dino's Lounge while having a cold brew.  Too bad they're only open till 1am on weekends as it'd be dope to have one or two of their sandwiches after a long night of drinking.\n\nFOIE& (foie gras p\u00e2t\u00e9, crispy chicken skin, caramelized onions, purple cabbage, almond)  One of my favorites that keeps me coming back to this place!!  Eat it on white bread and add extra crispy chicken skin for more crunch.  One of the guys actually mentioned how they let the chicken skin render in the oven instead of deep frying them.  How can a small shack outside of a dive bar afford to serve fois gras sandwiches for less than $10 bucks?!  Jake gets a great bargain from Artisanal Foods to create the p\u00e2t\u00e9--two parts duck liver and one part chicken liver.  TIP: Eat this sandwich on the spot or have them put the chicken skin on the side if you plan on eating elsewhere to avoid soggy chicken skin.\n\nREUBEN-ISH (corned beef, fennel kraut, switss, 1000 island dressing)  Definitely one of the best in the valley!!  Awesome idea for using fennel instead of cabbage since the anise flavor greatly compliments the meat as well as the marble rye bread.  Corned beef is also tender and quite tasty.  \n\nLE PIG (pork belly, pickled radish, chicharon, vinaigrette)  This sandwich was alright.  Thought it was a little bland and needed more seasoning.  Textures were great though-moist pork belly (homemade at Dino's kitchen) with that crunchy chicharon.  Isn't as greasy as the other sandwiches on the menu.\n\nFLUFF & NUTT (nutella, toasted marshmallow, crunch)  One of the few items on the menu that's good Monte Cristo style.  Tasted like a French toast stuffed with nutella and marshmallow.  Great for late breakfast or dessert.  Thought this was a little too sweet for my liking though.\n\nOverall, the Goodwich is one of the best sandwich joints in Las Vegas.  Amazing food, and superb customer service.  I definitely recommend this place over any other places in town.","business_id":"zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA","stars":5,"date":"2014-03-27","useful":2,"counts":{"limited":1,"monte":1,"outdoor":1,"soggy":1,"kraut":1,"cristo":1,"less":1,"also":1,"over":1,"corned":2,"fennel":2,"oven":1,"skin":5,"mentioned":1,"cold":1,"avenue":1,"toast":1,"style":1,"le":1,"$":1,"how":2,"(":5,"weekends":1,"wyoming":1,",":17,"actually":1,"late":1,"to":5,"only":1,"parts":1,"dressing":1,"sandwiches":3,"artisanal":1,"customer":1,"them":2,"jake":1,"keeps":1,"food":2,"dessert":1,"dope":1,"overall":1,"vegas":2,"they":2,"frying":1,"drinking":1,"having":1,"bread":2,"fluff":1,"gets":1,"bar":1,"like":2,"--":1,"valley":1,"crunchy":1,"with":2,"bad":1,"night":1,"1am":1,"side":1,"reuben-ish":1,"enjoy":1,"viva":1,"seating":1,"gras":2,"old":1,"be":1,"seasoning":1,"goodwich":2,"almond":1,"back":1,"tender":1,"liking":1,"chicken":6,"best":2,"for":6,"plan":1,"purple":1,"open":1,"avoid":1,"since":1,"nutella":2,"superb":1,"chicharon":2,"outside":1,"'re":1,"it":3,"?":1,"textures":1,"crunch":2,"after":1,"eating":1,"lunch\/dinner":1,"p\u00e2t\u00e9":2,"french":1,"quite":1,"small":1,"let":1,"shack":1,"put":1,"greasy":1,"on":8,"great":4,"beef":2,"eat":2,"items":1,"truck":1,"place":3,"greatly":1,"menu":2,"or":3,"1000":1,"render":1,"extra":1,"dino":2,"sweet":1,"alright":1,"pork":2,"one":7,"till":1,"duck":1,"bland":1,"switss":1,"crispy":2,"idea":1,"little":2,"from":1,"service":1,"&":2,"create":1,"anise":1,"add":1,"long":1,".":21,"their":1,"marshmallow":2,"of":10,"too":2,"stuffed":1,"recommend":1,"white":1,"kitchen":1,"was":3,"is":6,"more":2,"homemade":1,"that":3,"afford":1,"serve":1,"pickled":1,"arepas":1,"part":1,"liver":2,"quick":1,"an":1,"radish":1,"than":1,"me":1,"10":1,":":2,"compliments":1,"places":1,"this":7,"inside":1,"bargain":1,"n't":1,"while":1,"stall":1,"can":1,"were":1,"my":2,"marble":1,"and":7,"flavor":1,"tasted":1,"almost":1,"joints":1,"awesome":1,"few":1,"deep":1,"pig":1,"foods":1,"good":1,"tasty":1,"at":2,"have":2,"in":4,"blvd":1,"bucks":1,"breakfast":1,"onions":1,"any":1,"as":5,"elsewhere":1,"!":5,")":5,"nutt":1,"tip":2,"lounge":1,"located":1,"amazing":1,"other":2,"belly":2,"instead":2,"you":1,"if":1,"toasted":1,"rye":1,"sandwich":3,"'s":3,"though":1,"dive":1,"island":1,"spot":1,"fois":1,"town":1,"'d":1,"two":2,"favorites":1,"coming":1,"cabbage":2,"foie":2,"guys":1,"needed":1,"las":3,"a":11,"using":1,"i":1,"well":1,"meat":1,"thought":2,"definitely":2,"so":1,"brew":1,"vinaigrette":1,"very":1,"the":19,"though-moist":1,"caramelized":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":1}
