clear when booking through orbits that \"carry on was smaller than normal so you end up getting charged $100-$200 dollars more if you're bringing a carry on. It was $209 for the plane ticket and $150 for the carry on.  Bringing my flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to $359. I could have gone across the country for that price. Not too big of a deal except I was paying for two.  I could have flown for $230 southwest and had free snacks, and a free carry on.  I wish it would have been more clear that there is no \"free carry on\"  just a free \"free small personal item\"  Which they call a \"free carry on personal item\" when buying the ticket.  \n\nThe main problem was in the Vegas terminal they trick you by showing you a free box, that is almost the size of a regular carry on.    So you think oh cool maybe I don't have to pay $50 for this thing.  Then at the gate they're like nope doesn't fit so it's now $100 literally 25 minutes later.  Wow you got me Spirit.  Times that by two cause my GF was flying with me and I just got had for $100 bucks.  Pretty funny right? \n\nAbout 7 other people also made the same mistake.  When asked if they could just pay the $50 instead of the $100 because they were just offered the $50 dollar \"deal\" 20 minutes prior at the check in, as was I.  They were like \"nope you can ditch your bags, buy a smaller bag and stuff all your belongings in them and hope it fits into the \"free carry on box, or pay the $100 fee.\"  Those were the hard and fast choices provided to a bunch of very unhappy people.\n\nWhen the plane closed it's door and everyone was seated and the announcer said \"Welcome to Spirt Airlines.\"  It was literally met with a crowd of boos.  That is not an exaggeration. I of course chimed in.\n\nAll that being said had I not had a carry on, I wouldn't have minded the flight.  There was actually nothing wrong with service, the people are actually happier on this airline than on others for some odd reason.  Probably because they don't have to work as hard, because they aren't handing out free drinks all day.  Just a quick walk down the isle to see who's buying - On this flight maybe 5 takers. There was a definite hostility lingering in the air from people feeling raped by extortionist tactics, but if you can get past that, then the one hour flight to LA from Vegas was relatively painless.\n\nAnother note the flight there to Vegas from LA, where I paid at the check in for the bags and later thought that I didn't need to because they didn't seem to check for my receipt for the baggage payment, then was humbled in Vegas for my stupidity - Well on that flight we waited an hour on the tarmac for the flight to take off because of \"Weather to the east between LA and Vegas.\"  When we finally got cleared for take off via a route around the \"weather\" (in August in California there is no \"weather\", and the weather satellite agreed on my Iphone - no weather) Spirit doesn't put enough gas in for longer route to Vegas so we had to, after waiting an hour, go back to the gate to refuel, this caused 8 people on the flight to miss a connection to Chicago.\n\nDon't ever think they aren't checking if you paid your carry on fee. They absolutely do check. They had a code that says Zone 1 when you pay for a carry on.  They tell you this when you don't pay. It's not very obvious when you do. You kinda think hey maybe they don't check because it's so ridiculous to ask $100 for a carry on that the employees let it slide.  I really think this is on purpose to make you think you were crazy for paying $50 for a carry on for a one hour flight, then try not doing it and get caught for the $100 at the gate carry on fee.  So funny but so not at the same time.  \n\nHere's the sad part.  Spirt Airlines is one of the most profitable airlines in the world today. Since the 2011 IPO  the stock price is up over 400%.  It seems this may be the future model of air travel. \n\nSpirit Airlines was offering something like 15000 real miles of air travel for signing up for their Master Card on the flight back. The deal seemed too good to be true. If they are very profitable, then all I could think about this offer was how they could make a profit on all the \"free travel.\"  Then I realized I was offered a \"free carry on personal item: when I bought my ticket.\"  They play with words when they do their sales and promotion and it's designed to make you lose money and blame yourself because you didn't read the small print.  It's a hostile form of customer relations. And is the source of their title of \"Worst.\"","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2014-08-03","useful":0,"counts":{"all":5,"code":1,"caused":1,"dollar":1,"gf":1,"go":1,"seemed":1,"zone":1,"to":23,"finally":1,"southwest":1,"me":2,"very":3,"vegas":7,"worst":1,"minded":1,"ticket":3,"bringing":2,"cool":1,"did":3,"try":1,"item":3,"booking":1,"quick":1,"the":49,"smaller":2,"says":1,"past":1,"choices":1,"odd":1,"drinks":1,"n't":14,"chicago":1,"tarmac":1,"waiting":1,"ever":1,"spirt":2,"here":1,"met":1,"let":1,"others":1,"100":6,"box":2,"employees":1,"prior":1,"via":1,"ipo":1,"put":1,"yourself":1,"fee":3,"from":4,"would":2,"two":2,"call":1,"iphone":1,"tell":1,"today":1,"more":2,"``":14,"door":1,"pretty":1,"customer":1,"hour":4,"this":8,"getting":1,"obvious":1,"can":2,"my":6,"route":2,"crazy":1,"snacks":1,"something":1,"230":1,"end":1,"travel":3,"1":1,"how":1,"stupidity":1,"gate":3,"stock":1,"funny":2,"may":1,"after":1,"orbits":1,"wrong":1,"plane":2,"designed":1,"belongings":1,"las":1,"a":23,"realized":1,"maybe":3,"baggage":1,"so":7,"over":1,"course":1,"through":1,"bunch":1,"25":1,"20":1,"fit":1,"la":3,"personal":3,",":18,"actually":2,"400":1,"main":1,"2011":1,"then":6,"them":1,"good":1,"they":18,"instead":1,"not":6,"now":1,"extortionist":1,"day":1,"slide":1,"signing":1,"everyone":1,"doing":1,"hard":2,"out":1,"announcer":1,"since":1,"stuff":1,"7":1,"print":1,"got":3,"cause":1,"free":11,"small":2,"reason":1,"california":1,"ask":1,"card":1,"100-":1,"hostile":1,"could":5,"times":1,"thing":1,"promotion":1,"think":6,"waited":1,"flying":1,"one":3,"fits":1,"another":1,"15000":1,"carry":15,"ditch":1,"miss":1,"size":1,"service":1,"caught":1,"relations":1,"their":3,"master":1,"too":2,"lingering":1,"that":12,"part":1,"than":2,"seated":1,"future":1,"were":4,"feeling":1,"and":17,"sad":1,"buy":1,"have":6,"need":1,"seem":1,"relatively":1,"form":1,"-":3,"note":1,"also":1,"take":2,"which":1,"200":1,"play":1,"normal":1,"209":1,"price":2,"who":1,"paid":2,"most":1,"regular":1,"nothing":1,"cleared":1,"payment":1,"clear":2,"later":2,"ridiculous":1,"agreed":1,"title":1,"(":1,"unhappy":1,"terminal":1,"chimed":1,"8":1,"hope":1,"do":8,"exaggeration":1,"get":2,"hostility":1,"words":1,"humbled":1,"bag":1,"miles":1,"where":1,"see":1,"are":4,"said":2,"wow":1,"definite":1,"enough":1,"closed":1,"between":1,"probably":1,"nope":2,"across":1,"bought":1,"we":3,"august":1,"blame":1,"country":1,"connection":1,"asked":1,"150":1,"had":6,"walk":1,"handing":1,"airlines":4,"been":1,".":46,"flight":10,"offered":2,"gas":1,"spirit":3,"those":1,"paying":2,"air":3,"trick":1,"mistake":1,"almost":1,"is":8,"it":13,"in":11,"bucks":1,"if":5,"bags":2,")":1,"pay":5,"make":3,"same":2,"read":1,"isle":1,"satellite":1,"painless":1,"flown":1,"purpose":1,"takers":1,"off":2,"i":17,"well":1,"thought":1,"model":1,"359":1,"charged":1,"just":5,"being":1,"money":1,"profitable":2,"$":16,"seems":1,"except":1,"refuel":1,"source":1,"east":1,"real":1,"around":1,"checking":1,"big":1,"showing":1,"world":1,"like":3,"50":4,"true":1,"lose":1,"because":7,"deal":3,"people":5,"absolutely":1,"some":1,"back":2,"provided":1,"for":23,"literally":2,"does":2,"?":1,"be":2,"by":3,"on":25,"about":2,"oh":1,"of":13,"dollars":1,"angeles":1,"airline":1,"or":1,"into":1,"down":1,"weather":5,"your":3,"crowd":1,"there":5,"hey":1,"fast":1,"raped":1,"los":1,":":1,"was":16,"receipt":1,"offering":1,"offer":1,"but":2,"with":4,"buying":2,"made":1,"tactics":1,"wish":1,"up":3,"'re":2,"problem":1,"minutes":2,"gone":1,"sales":1,"an":3,"''":12,"as":2,"right":1,"at":5,"work":1,"check":5,"%":1,"no":3,"boos":1,"when":10,"other":1,"5":1,"you":18,"really":1,"'s":8,"welcome":1,"kinda":1,"happier":1,"longer":1,"profit":1,"time":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

I've flown to and from Miami as well as Las Vegas.  The first time I flew round trip to and from Miami was the better trip and only price wise, $188. I traveled real light that time so I wasn't too privy to all the nickel and diming that the airline hits you with.  I do agree that you should just spend the few extra bucks and fly with a better airline, it all kind of works out price wise after you check a bag or two and buy a Coke.  The most recent to and from Vegas is detailed as follows (review by Beatriz T.):\n\nUgh where to even gatdamn start on this airline.\n\nFirst time flying on this \"airline\" going to Vegas. Bought the tickets for pretty cheap and now I know why, by the time I boarded the airplane I had spent an extra million dollars on EVERYTHING they charge you for.\n\nThey charge you for printing out a boarding pass, carry on bags, checked bags, being fat, being short, having bad breath, having big tits, having one bad eye, having your fingernails painted.....you get my drift.\nYou can't even get a free can of pop on that bitch, but you can get a Styrofoam cup of oodles of noodles for 3 dollars. Get out of my face.\nWith 3 bucks I can go buy a 24 case of those.\n\nThe only thing that I loved about this airline was the flight attendant by the name of Joe on my flight back to Chicago from Vegas.\nThis stupid ass lady was asking him about the noises the plane was making before take-off and trying to be \"funny\" about something being wrong on the plane which could have seriously caused someone not comfortable with flying to have an extreme panic attack. (like me) She kept on and on and on....he finally turned to her and said:\n\nJoe: \"Do you want to get off the plane too?\"  (One guy had just been thrown off for public intoxication\"\n\nDumb Ass Lady: \"No\"\n\nJoe: \"Then I suggest you be quiet\"\n\nMe and my brother had a good laugh about that for about an hour into the flight.\n\nSave your money and fly a better airline.....by the time you're done with Spirit your airfare will be about 2 thousand bucks.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":2,"date":"2014-12-04","useful":4,"counts":{"all":2,"ugh":1,"just":2,"from":4,"being":3,"caused":1,"cheap":1,"go":1,"before":1,"24":1,"now":2,"$":1,"cup":1,"(":3,"had":3,",":12,"should":1,"better":3,"to":12,"finally":1,"going":1,"4":1,"pretty":1,"money":1,"save":1,"ca":1,"real":1,"do":2,"someone":1,"tits":1,"get":5,"big":1,"flew":1,"vegas":4,"know":1,"they":2,"airfare":1,"not":1,"traveled":1,"lady":2,"him":1,"like":1,"tickets":1,"name":1,"miami":2,"follows":1,"brother":1,"'ve":1,"t.":1,"bag":1,"bad":2,"stupid":1,"she":1,"guy":1,"works":1,"boarded":1,"round":1,"ass":2,"back":1,"dumb":1,"pass":1,"noodles":1,"out":3,"even":2,"n't":2,"said":1,"for":6,"chicago":1,"review":1,"fat":1,"everything":1,"3":2,"asking":1,"boarding":1,"public":1,"?":1,"bought":1,".he":1,"be":3,"million":1,"free":1,"highly":1,"joe":3,"recent":1,"checked":1,"attendant":1,"by":3,"extreme":1,"thrown":1,"on":10,"hits":1,"oodles":1,"agree":1,"diming":1,"where":1,"dollars":2,"quiet":1,"times":1,"thing":1,"flown":2,"airline":6,"or":1,"first":2,"and":15,"extra":2,"into":1,"pop":1,"one":2,"done":1,"bitch":1,"laugh":1,"carry":1,"your":3,"gatdamn":1,"charge":2,"eye":1,"her":1,"few":1,"flying":2,"only":2,"been":1,".":16,"breath":1,"start":1,"attack":1,"2":1,"too":2,"seriously":1,"188":1,":":5,"was":5,"spent":1,"..you":1,"``":5,"buy":2,"flight":3,"that":6,"painted":1,"coke":1,"recommend":1,"about":6,"but":1,"intoxication":1,"...":3,"off":2,"trying":1,"with":6,"spirit":2,"those":1,"me":2,"loved":1,"kind":1,"wise":2,"take-off":1,"hour":1,"this":4,"beatriz":1,"privy":1,"will":1,"printing":1,"can":4,"case":1,"of":7,"making":1,"my":4,"could":1,"at":1,"detailed":1,"have":3,"then":1,"is":1,"turned":1,"it":2,"an":3,"''":6,"fly":2,"say":1,"good":1,"something":1,"want":1,"bucks":3,"nickel":1,"airplane":1,"trip":2,"as":3,"bags":2,"comfortable":1,"noises":1,")":2,"suggest":1,"check":1,"which":1,"you":10,"panic":1,"thousand":1,"'s":1,"fingernails":1,"funny":1,"price":2,"after":1,"drift":1,"styrofoam":1,"most":1,"wrong":1,"plane":3,"two":1,"..by":1,"nothing":1,"why":1,"las":1,"a":9,"short":1,"least":1,"spend":1,"i":13,"light":1,"no":1,"well":1,"kept":1,"face":1,"'re":1,"so":1,"time":5,"the":18,"having":4},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

That is Spirit Airlines. Truly the worst U.S. airline. It is staffed by the type of gum popping, brusque personnel that you'd expect to be working the cashier at a Jack in the Box. \n\nMy return flight from Las Vegas last night was delayed from 9:45 pm to 11:30 pm. No problem I thought; it happens. \n\nHowever, that time came and went even though the plane had landed and was parked at our gate. About midnight, one of the gate agents announced that the plane had a \"maintenance issue\" and that they would try to update us in 20 minutes. They updated us three times over the next hour that the issue was still being addressed. They were very opaque about what was going on. \n\nAt about 1 a.m., the gate agent announced that the flight had been canceled \"because of weather.\" The crowd --not surprisingly-- was angry. One guy challenged the agent, who had been surly and incommunicative throughout, how it could be a weather issue. She said that the plane had encountered weather at La Guardia but didn't elaborate on how that had anything to do with us getting back to California. And why were we waiting on the supposed maintenance issue for the last hour? She had no answers and was clearly not dealing truthfully with us. Some of the passengers began chanting \"Spirit sucks, Spirit sucks.\" I'm not kidding. \n\nThey herded us downstairs to rebook. That took another 45 minutes. When I asked if they would provide me with a hotel voucher, they informed me that they would not because the cause of the delay was weather, even though that was clearly not true. They also informed me that I couldn't get on the next Spirt flight back until 9:45 pm the next night!  I had them refund the trip and booked a return flight on Southwest the next morning, which felt like flying first class on the Concorde compared to the dismal experience with Spirit.\n\nLive and learn. Don't fly Spirit Airlines. They nickel and dime you with fees until you end up paying nearly the same amount as other airlines, then treat you with contempt and incompetence.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2015-10-29","useful":2,"counts":{"refund":1,"45":1,"being":1,"over":1,"midnight":1,"parked":1,"still":1,"staff":1,"1":1,"20":1,"la":1,"downstairs":1,"had":8,",":14,"to":7,"going":1,"southwest":2,"11:30":1,"then":2,"updated":1,"good":1,"return":2,"get":1,"very":1,"truly":1,"me":3,"vegas":1,"worst":1,"jack":1,"they":9,"not":5,"helpful":1,"like":2,"--":2,"issue":4,"gum":1,"morning":1,"try":1,"did":1,"she":2,"night":2,"went":1,"asked":1,"because":2,"crowd":1,"challenged":1,"dealing":1,"some":1,"back":2,"opposite":1,"expect":1,"surly":1,"our":1,"popping":1,"really":1,"happens":1,"what":1,"said":1,"for":1,"opaque":1,"dime":1,"herded":1,"waiting":1,"rebook":1,";":1,"three":1,"cause":1,"spirt":1,"announced":2,"be":2,"we":1,"who":1,"u.s.":1,"were":2,"however":1,"answers":1,"update":1,"discount":1,"california":1,"competent":1,"by":1,"box":1,"on":6,"about":4,"even":2,"last":2,"working":1,"anything":1,"getting":1,"guy":1,"of":6,"could":2,"experience":1,"times":1,"amount":1,"plane":3,"a.m.":1,"airline":2,"chanting":1,"think":2,"first":1,"?":1,"one":2,"why":1,"addressed":1,"weather":4,"agents":1,"another":1,"fees":1,"throughout":1,"guardia":1,"truthfully":1,"from":2,"would":3,"angry":1,"flying":1,"informed":2,"airlines":3,"been":2,"next":4,"live":1,"treat":1,"maintenance":2,"was":8,"until":2,"pm":3,"``":3,"flight":4,"passengers":1,"with":6,"hotel":1,"cashier":1,"delayed":1,"but":1,"it":3,"landed":1,"warm":1,"dismal":1,"true":1,"spirit":5,"paying":1,"also":1,"hour":2,"canceled":1,"brusque":1,"type":1,"sucks":2,"up":1,"us":5,"n't":3,"supposed":1,"how":2,"learn":1,"problem":1,"my":1,"elaborate":1,"voucher":1,"and":10,"kidding":1,"do":2,"minutes":2,"is":2,"surprisingly":1,"agent":2,"encountered":1,"''":3,"fly":1,"as":1,"at":5,"in":2,"nickel":1,"clearly":2,"contempt":1,"if":1,"!":1,"compared":1,"end":1,"no":2,"provide":1,"personnel":1,"began":1,"that":13,"when":1,"same":1,"trip":1,"delay":1,".":24,"other":1,"which":1,"gate":3,"you":4,"incommunicative":1,"though":2,"incompetence":1,"felt":1,"staffed":1,"took":1,"'d":1,"'m":1,"class":1,"las":1,"a":6,"booked":1,"9:45":2,"i":5,"concorde":1,"them":1,"thought":1,"time":1,"the":28,"came":1,"nearly":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

Other than that, it was a horrible experience. Things to know:\n1. You have to buy your seats if you want to sit with the people you are traveling with. This can range between $7.00-$65.00. It's best if you are traveling alone or don't like your travel partners.\n2. They charge for bags and carry ons. and charge you more if you don't buy them online. When I mean charge you, I mean $40.00 for a suitcase purchased online and $40.00 for a carry on. NO FREE CARRY ONS. \n3. They consider a heavy bag to be anything over 40 pounds- not 50 like most. They wait to tell you until you have all your stuff in your suitcase. When it is over weight, your bag is an extra $100.00. People were unloading their suitcases on the belt, shoving shoes and random things into backpacks to try to get the weight down. \n4. The tray table wasn't a table at all. It held my IPhone and that was about it. \n5. The seats are so smushed that I could not move and I am a woman that is 5'4 and wears a size 8. I could not move. The first time in my life I was  glad I wasn't a tall leggy woman. \n6. The seats did not recline and the backs were bungee cords.\n7.

Not only do you pay for your flight but you have to pay for your seat you would think that paying  for ticket would include your seat but it doesn't\n4. And speaking of the seats they are the most uncomfortable seats you will Ever sit in, they tell you they recline but they really mean they are pre-recline for you , So they do not move at all\n5. And when they say you get one personal item to carry on they really mean ! You can have a suitcase , But in our case ladies a PURSE becomes your one personal item and at the door they will charge you 100 bucks just for your purse\n6. My round trip both ways were delayed I'm thinking this is common practice!!! So if you're getting a connecting flight and Spirit airlines  flight is delayed good luck \n7.

After numerous flight delays that completely ruined our trip, we got to the airport over an hour before the flights departure time. There was a huge line to check bags and each bag was $50 to check and EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE to carry on at $60! So after paying the crazy fees for checking bags,  we ask for some help and that we're in a hurry. Their response, \"That's your problem, not ours.\" So, our flight is at 10pm, we get to the airport before 9pm and are done checking bags at 9:30. We tell them that since they took so long, we're worried about making our flight.  She says you have time to make the flight but you're bags may not make it until the next flight. \n\nWe were worried we won't make our flight but security only took about 10-15min so we got to the gate 15min prior to our flight AND they did not let us on... AGAIN we got there 15min before takeoff and they wouldn't let us on even though we paid and checked our bags.  So we then hoped that our bags didn't make it, but NO the bags made it but somehow we didn't AND they won't refund us for anything, they were not helpful in explaining WHY as I still don't have a reason other than the Captain wanted it and a complete LIE about us being called on the speakers which never happened. I understand the airline industry is going through struggles, but this is theft.  They took our money, did not provide a service to us when we made it there EARLY.  Then, even after they royally screwed us, they weren't even apologetic or bothered to offer us an explanation.  They kept repeating the blame on the Pilot and saying that there's nothing they could do and there is no supervisor.\n\nNo help at all, no accountability at all. No desire to help us out with a rental car that we had to drive at 12am to make it to work on time from Vegas to LA. No refund for the checked bags that they shipped without letting us which contained all of my personal belongings.  The worst part is that we got the opposite of an apology, we got disrespected.

That said, I traveled from Las Vegas to Oakland this weekend and it was by far the worst experience I have ever encountered on a flight.  \n\n1. I'm well aware of Spirit's hidden fees, so I'm always sure to prepay online for my baggage. That said, as I was checking in my other prepaid bag, I made sure to have my other bag in full view and have it checked by the Spirit customer service team.  I was assured it was compliant for the flight and I would not have to pay an additional charge.   Upon arriving at the gate, I was stopped by the Spirit employee and informed I would need to pay for my overhead baggage.  I explained to them that I had just had a conversation with their customer service team at the baggage check and they had cleared me. I was given no explanation and was just rudely continually told I needed to pay.  I complied and now the price had jumped from $37 to $100 to check one carry on bag, one way.  Somewhere between the luggage check and the gate, the price jumps to $100?  That's embarrassing.  That's not customer service.  That's blatantly lying to you customers to force them into increasing the revenue on your flight.  Where is any sort of ethical code with this company? \n\n2. The flight attendants were beyond rude.  Granted they were dealing with a very hostile guest who was sitting very close to me and he was eventually arrested, but I was on my way to the Bay Area to celebrate my birthday with my girlfriend and all we encountered was attitude from the entire flight attendant team. It made no sense.  Additionally, I observed being like this to the majority of guests. \n\n3. Also, add on the fact that the flight was over an hour delayed (which happens), but not once did the flight communicate to us what was going on.  I don't expect full details, but to ignore us and get frustrated with anyone who asked them is unacceptable. \n\nSadly, I won't ever fly Spirit Airlines again.   Don't make that mistake.  It's awful.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2015-06-29","useful":1,"counts":{"all":1,"code":1,"just":2,"being":1,"over":1,"unacceptable":1,"not":3,"attitude":1,"oakland":1,"1":1,"$":3,"also":1,"somewhere":1,"(":1,"had":4,",":13,"to":18,"charge":1,"going":1,"employee":1,"hidden":1,"details":1,"do":2,"them":3,"prepaid":1,"sitting":1,"far":1,"vegas":1,"worst":1,"they":2,"hands":1,"arriving":1,"now":1,"celebrate":1,"entire":1,"like":1,"did":1,"always":1,"arrested":1,"bay":1,"ignore":1,"bag":3,"stopped":1,"team":3,"where":1,"traveled":1,"view":1,"ethical":1,"because":1,"force":1,"dealing":1,"observed":1,"expect":1,"close":1,"beyond":1,"out":1,"happens":1,"reviews":1,"what":1,"complied":1,"for":3,"jumped":1,"continually":1,"3":1,"hostile":1,"between":1,"it":5,"increasing":1,"ever":2,"?":2,"told":1,"we":1,"full":2,"assured":1,"wo":1,"jumps":1,"communicate":1,"from":3,"100":2,"by":3,"additional":1,"on":6,"about":1,"would":2,"luggage":1,"of":5,"37":1,"experience":1,"conversation":1,"airline":1,"asked":1,"rudely":1,"very":2,"revenue":1,"into":1,"explained":1,"one":2,"guests":1,"fees":1,"carry":1,"rarely":1,"your":1,"given":1,"checked":1,"guest":1,"service":3,"area":1,"attendant":1,"informed":1,"add":1,".":24,"anyone":1,"needed":1,"compliant":1,"2":1,"overhead":1,"way":2,"was":13,"sort":1,"flight":7,"said":2,"that":8,"explanation":1,"delayed":1,"but":3,"aware":1,"checking":1,"understand":1,"encountered":2,"with":5,"spirit":4,"he":1,"me":2,"prepay":1,"made":2,"hour":1,"this":3,"sadly":1,"us":2,"air":1,"n't":3,"were":2,"my":7,"mistake":1,"and":11,"attendants":1,"embarrassing":1,"eventually":1,"is":3,"in":2,"customers":1,"an":2,"fly":1,"as":1,"customer":3,"have":4,"sense":1,"girlfriend":1,"their":1,"blatantly":1,"again":1,"no":2,")":1,"pay":3,"make":1,"get":1,"check":3,"write":1,"majority":1,"need":1,"other":2,"airlines":2,"which":1,"online":1,"granted":1,"gate":2,"you":1,"company":1,"sure":2,"'s":6,"rude":1,"any":1,"price":2,"who":2,"upon":1,"much":1,"birthday":1,"additionally":1,"awful":1,"'m":2,"cleared":1,"weekend":1,"las":1,"a":3,"especially":1,"i":21,"well":1,"baggage":3,"frustrated":1,"so":1,"lying":1,"at":2,"the":19,"travel":1,"fact":1,"once":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

The first flights were fine with the exception of the flight attendant lying to us. He told us that if we signed up for a Spirit Airlines credit card we could book three round trip flights to Las Vegas for free. Since I was returning from Las Vegas this sounded appealing and so I signed up. Many others signed up as well. When I tried to book a flight, the fifteen thousand points provided was not even close to the fifty thousand required for one round trip flight. I did not even receive a discount. After feeling cheated I cancelled the card. \nThe flight was similar to Southwest with the exception of the flight attendants not providing peanuts and drinks. I did not mind this. \nBefore my second trip, I called the customer service number to request my flight information since I could not find it in my email. She also tried to make me sign up for a Spirit Airlines credit card by lying and telling me I could receive three round trip flights for signing up for the credit card. I told her that was not true and she said I could get a round trip flight for as little as twenty thousand points. She contradicted herself because you get fifteen thousand points for signing up. After providing the call center rep. with my email address, I was assured an itinerary would be sent to me. It was not so I called again. I was given my itinerary verbally but the return flight was incorrect. I was told it would be at 2:12pm when in fact it was at 9:55pm. I found this out after arriving at the airport at 12:15pm the day of departure and checking in. After explaining to the Spirit Airlines lady behind the desk at the airport, she told me there was nothing she could do. I spoke with three  Spirit Airlines employees including a manager and they did nothing. I waited almost ten hours for my flight. \nThis company lied about the credit card both on the flight and at the call center, did not send me an itinerary after I called them, and provided me with incorrect information about my departure. There is zero accountability. With no accountability and poor customer service, it is my opinion that this company will not thrive without significant changes.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2014-09-28","useful":0,"counts":{"fifty":1,"telling":1,"manager":1,"including":1,"fine":1,"find":1,"before":1,"true":1,",":7,"send":1,"to":9,"flights":4,"peanuts":1,"sent":1,"southwest":1,"customer":2,"them":1,"return":1,"returning":1,"checking":1,"vegas":2,"they":1,"desk":1,"not":9,"lady":1,"day":1,"rep.":1,"did":4,"she":5,"found":1,"out":1,"round":4,"signing":2,"because":1,"ten":1,"sign":1,"second":1,"signed":3,"close":1,"drinks":1,"even":2,"provided":2,"said":1,"for":10,"arriving":1,"since":2,"behind":1,"verbally":1,"get":2,"email":2,"thrive":1,"told":4,"be":2,"we":2,"assured":1,"points":3,"little":1,"free":1,"hours":1,"discount":1,"2:12pm":1,"others":1,"attendant":1,"fifteen":2,"by":1,"card":5,"on":2,"about":2,"providing":2,"service":2,"receive":2,"of":3,"could":5,"credit":4,"airport":2,"airline":1,"opinion":1,"changes":1,"waited":1,"first":1,"lied":1,"address":1,"number":1,"one":1,".":25,"given":1,"from":1,"spoke":1,"her":1,"twenty":1,"there":2,"airlines":4,"accountability":2,"center":2,"call":2,"was":11,"attendants":1,"flight":10,"both":1,"with":6,"thousand":4,"but":1,"herself":1,"spirit":4,"he":1,"me":6,"exception":2,"this":6,"up":6,"us":2,"will":1,"roundtrip":1,"appealing":1,"three":3,"itinerary":3,"were":1,"cancelled":1,"feeling":1,"similar":1,"called":3,"and":9,"would":2,"employees":1,"do":1,"almost":1,"well":1,"is":2,"mind":1,"it":5,"an":2,"as":3,"at":6,"have":1,"in":3,"my":8,"trip":5,"if":1,"incorrect":2,"information":2,"zero":1,"no":1,"make":1,"that":3,"when":2,"also":1,"book":2,"you":1,"many":1,"company":2,"poor":1,"explaining":1,"tried":2,"again":1,"12:15pm":1,"after":5,"contradicted":1,"flown":1,"two":1,"significant":1,"nothing":2,"las":2,"a":6,"9:55pm":1,"cheated":1,"i":20,"required":1,"request":1,"departure":2,"without":1,"so":2,"lying":2,"the":21,"sounded":1,"fact":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

I let them know we had a flight leaving in an hour but they told us to just wait in line. There were two people in front of us. By the time we got to the counter the woman said they closed the flight and they could not let us on. The next available flight was the next day in the afternoon. I asked for a refund, she said no, you were late. Pardon me? We had been waiting in line the entire time! There was a woman who was crying at the next counter over, she had been dealing with them to the point they made her late and refused to let her on as well. THIS IS ON THEM just like our situation. WE bought Alaska tickets to get home, and went to a lounge to wait the 8 hours before our flight. I told the desk attendant never to fly Spirit airlines, and he told us his story that happened about 7 years ago. He and his father were flying from  a very small airport in Arizona. They got there early and waited at the gate with no one there. No one at the Spirit desk. The employee then arrives about a half hour before the flight, and they had been waiting for 45 minutes.

The other option is to pay $125 to modify the ticket to another date, which is slightly reasonable. What was not reasonable was telling a mourning grandchild that they must immediately pick a date to modify their trip for a funeral. When I was disappointed to hear that they had no grievance policy, I informed them that I would need to call back since I was unsure of the funeral dates. The operator's response was \"Just to let you know Ms. Perez, when you call back our policies will not change.\" I work in a profession that allows our employees to do what is in the customer's best interest. I am truly disappointed and disgusted with Spirit Airlines. I encourage everyone I know to never fly this airline. It is not worth the money saved flying a discount airline.

I've never had a bad experience with Spirit until yesterday evening, and because of it, I will never use this airline again. My husband and I dropped our 16-year old daughter off, but one of us wanted to escort her in to ensure she safely made it to her terminal. We went to the desk to request a guest pass so I could walk back with her. The \"woman\" (and I use that term very loosely) asked how she could assist us. I told her I needed a pass and she asked how old my daughter was. I told her she was 16, and the \"woman\" asked \"um, can she talk?\". I responded, \"we're her parents, and she is 16\". Then some other attendant with horrible pink, long nails-completely unpolished and unprofessional, told me that their company considers any child over 15 an adult, per TSA. Being that my husband is a Director over a global company and I an executive, we checked this information versus what's available online via TSA. It said it RECOMMENDS for parents\/guardians to escort their minor to their appropriate location for safety purposes. As a parent, I'll escort my daughter each time until she's 18-who the hell are YOU? Needless to say, I got my pass and went on about my business. My husband went back and talked to a manager regarding this, but I feel this needs to be addressed in its totality to avoid instances like this occurring again.

As several people have mentioned...you get what you pay for. I, unfortunately, learned the hard way. Our plane was almost two hours late (weather) arriving from the east coast. We had a three hour layover in Chicago, so we still had time to make the connection. Once on the plane, we pulled back and stopped. The captain then came on and said the plane was scheduled for routine maintenance, which should take about 20 minutes. An hour later we finally were cleared for take off. Knowing we used up all our spare time, it was going to be tight in Chicago. Unfortunately, the flight took even longer than expected due to some storms and we arrived in Chicago 20 minutes after our plane to Orlando departed. That was the last flight to Orlando that day. Checking with the gate agent, she coldly said \"well, we can refund this portion of your trip\" leaving us stranded in Chicago. She could have cared less about us or our problems. I then spoke with the ticketing supervisor, who actually cared. He booked us on the first flight the following day, but since they said the missed flight was caused by weather, we'd be responsible for our own lodging. They didn't know anything about the hour long \"routine maintenance\" delay of which I spoke. We stayed right in O'Hare at the Hilton ($275), jumped on the plane the next morning and had a great time in Orlando. \n\nBottom line is between the terrible service, the \"I could care less attitude\" and all the ridiculous fees...you're better off hitchhiking. \n\nDO NOT BE FOOLED BY THEIR LOW AIR FARES! After the fees and terrible service, it's not any cheaper. With the poor attitudes from the front line employees, I can't imagine the mechanics any better...and I really don't want a mechanic with a bad attitude working on the plane I'm going to be flying on.\n\nThis airline should be embarrassed by the terrible reviews, here and on other sites. \n\nNever again.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-07-20","useful":0,"counts":{"refund":1,"all":2,"departed":1,"less":2,"caused":1,"arriving":1,"attitude":2,"mentioned":1,"still":1,"20":2,"$":1,"tight":1,"front":1,"(":2,"had":4,",":18,"should":2,"late":1,"to":7,"o'hare":1,"going":2,"attitudes":1,"fares":1,"east":1,"scheduled":1,"then":3,"get":1,"checking":1,"routine":2,"flew":1,"coast":1,"vegas":1,"know":1,"they":2,"not":2,"day":2,"several":1,"did":1,"orlando":4,"morning":1,"bad":1,"stopped":1,"she":2,"lodging":1,"right":1,"people":1,"hard":1,"some":1,"back":1,"275":1,"layover":1,"our":5,"out":1,"even":1,"n't":3,"what":1,"captain":1,"ticketing":1,"for":4,"chicago":5,"jumped":1,"since":1,"sites":1,"connecting":1,"between":1,"learned":1,"can":1,"knowing":1,"be":5,"we":10,"after":2,"never":1,"hitchhiking":1,"here":1,"hours":1,"spare":1,"imagine":1,"by":3,"care":1,"on":8,"about":3,"last":1,"service":2,"anything":1,"of":3,"could":2,"terrible":4,"experience":1,"leaving":1,"connection":1,"'d":1,"airline":1,"or":1,"first":1,"and":9,"own":1,"storms":1,"ca":1,"due":1,"embarrassed":1,"weather":2,"fees":2,"actually":1,"your":1,"better":2,"from":2,"spoke":2,"working":1,"flying":1,"finally":1,"long":1,"next":1,"cared":2,"their":1,"low":1,"maintenance":2,"expected":1,"was":5,"``":3,"flight":5,"way":1,"that":2,"said":3,"great":1,"but":1,"ridiculous":1,"...":3,"fooled":1,"line":2,"with":4,"than":1,"he":1,"unfortunately":2,"hour":3,"this":2,"up":1,"us":3,"air":1,"reviews":1,"'re":1,"three":1,"mechanic":1,"were":1,"following":1,"minutes":2,"employees":1,"mechanics":1,"later":1,"supervisor":1,"have":2,"do":2,"almost":1,"is":1,"it":2,"agent":1,"an":1,"''":3,"as":1,"hilton":1,"at":1,"want":1,"in":7,"trip":1,"!":1,"again":1,")":2,"pay":1,"make":1,"responsible":1,"portion":1,"stayed":1,"any":2,"delay":1,".":23,"other":1,"take":2,"which":2,"gate":1,"you":3,"really":1,"poor":1,"used":1,"'s":1,"who":1,"problems":1,"bottom":1,"took":1,"plane":6,"arrived":1,"two":1,"'m":1,"cleared":1,"missed":1,"a":5,"booked":1,"off":2,"longer":1,"i":7,"cheaper":1,"stranded":1,"well":1,"coldly":1,"so":1,"time":3,"the":26,"pulled":1,"came":1,"once":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

If your carry-on luggage will not fit under an airline seat, pay the fee in advance of your flight because it will cost you more at the check-in desk and $100 at the gate!

As I mentioned, it's no frills, so there is a fee to choose your seats and for beverages and snacks.

The staff at the airports have always been pleasant and courteous. They also have great last minute deals in case your flight is An emergency or if you're going on a spontaneous adventure.  People have said that their flights are bumpy and rickety but I've always had smooth sailing\nNow, here's what doesn't work. I'm about 6'3 and 210 pounds so I expect to be cramped, but their flights take it to another level. Their bag check in fees are higher than most. Their seat choice fee is higher than mist, hell just about anything an airline charges for is higher with spirit. They also love to find ways to nickel and dime the customers.  They also don't have much variety in the sense that their routes only fly once a day, for example the only Vegas to Baltimore flight is an 1130 red eye. It's a deal breaker unless you're flexible.

Usually I've been very happy with them since they got me from point A to point B, and I was savvy enough to not fall for their add-ons. I usually take Spirit Airlines on short weekend trips that don't require much packing.\n\nI've been carrying around a little roll-on suitcase that has passed for a personal item for years. In fact, it fits perfectly in the metal baggage measuring thing. But this time, the lady collecting my ticket immediately said my bag was too big. \n\nI put my suitcase inside that thing to show them that it fits... but oh wait... it's a smidgeon (literally half an inch or less) ABOVE the metal bar and therefore I have to either pay $100 to carry it on or take it to the kiosk downstairs for $50. The lady was RUDE, unsympathetic and dismissive. I tried telling her that I came on the plane with the same luggage for years and that Spirit has always let me pass it for a personal item. She just replied, \"There is no free baggage. Is your choice. Doors close in 10 minutes\". \n\nWhen boarding on a plane, apparently a woman's seat has been moved up to 3C. The gate attendant stormed in and said in a very rude tone, \"MA'AM your seat has been moved up to 3C.\" The lady was already dozing off and didn't reply. \"MA'AM. MA'AM. YOUR SEAT HAS BEEN MOVED TO 3C\" like a billion times. \"You need to get up and move to 3C\". Luckily, one of the passengers quickly jumped on that opportunity and offered to sit in that seat instead. \n\nNot only that, this ride home was particularly uncomfortable. Sitting up at 90 degrees with no recline was the most uncomfortable thing ever. I think they really packed in those seats over time. \n\nDon't encourage this company with your business! They know we like the cheap prices and that they can get away with being extremely rude.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2014-10-21","useful":4,"counts":{"replied":1,"particularly":1,"convinced":1,"just":1,"show":1,"being":1,"money":1,"over":1,"move":1,"cheap":1,"years":3,"telling":1,"seats":1,"$":2,"personal":2,"(":1,"point":2,",":10,"to":12,"ma'am":3,"degrees":1,"pay":1,"has":5,"take":2,"do":2,"them":3,"woman":1,"around":1,"get":2,"very":2,"big":1,"couple":1,"choice":1,"vegas":1,"know":1,"they":4,"fall":1,"not":2,"immediately":1,"ticket":1,"now":1,"lady":3,"bar":1,"like":2,"did":1,"always":1,"50":1,"'ve":3,"bag":1,"she":1,"inside":1,"seat":4,"uncomfortable":2,"pass":1,"close":1,"roll-on":1,"really":1,"said":2,"for":7,"item":2,"jumped":1,"away":1,"since":1,"enough":1,"above":1,"3c":4,"got":1,"ever":1,"either":1,"measuring":1,"gate":2,"we":1,"weekend":1,"business":1,"never":1,"free":1,"unsympathetic":1,"packing":1,"let":1,"sitting":1,"put":1,"100":1,"wait":1,"on":5,"last":1,"oh":1,"of":2,"experience":1,"times":1,"thing":3,"airport":1,"encourage":1,"usually":2,"reply":1,"or":2,"and":9,"already":1,"tone":1,"add-ons":1,"one":1,"carry":1,".":24,"your":4,"little":1,"from":1,"her":1,"attendant":1,"opportunity":1,"there":1,"airlines":1,"been":6,"quickly":1,"their":1,"much":1,"therefore":1,"passed":1,"time":2,"perfectly":1,"was":6,"is":2,"too":1,"attendants":1,"a":11,"``":4,"only":1,"passengers":1,"downstairs":1,"offered":1,"kiosk":1,"but":3,"luckily":1,"carrying":1,"prices":1,"90":1,"with":6,"spirit":3,"those":1,"me":3,"boarding":1,"b":1,"this":3,"ride":1,"luggage":1,"up":4,"n't":3,"smidgeon":1,"can":1,"suitcase":2,"happy":1,"my":5,"trips":1,"at":2,"collecting":1,"...":2,"minutes":1,"half":1,"in":7,"moved":3,"it":6,"an":1,"''":4,"customer":1,"have":1,"home":1,"need":1,"apparently":1,"!":1,"again":1,"'ll":1,"no":2,")":1,"dismissive":1,"that":11,"when":1,"off":1,"same":1,"packed":1,"doors":1,"inch":1,"instead":1,"you":1,"company":1,"10":1,"'s":2,"tried":1,"rude":3,"less":1,"recline":1,"require":1,"most":1,"plane":2,"stormed":1,"fits":2,"dozing":1,"extremely":1,"las":1,"billion":1,"short":1,"give":1,"i":11,"sit":1,"metal":2,"think":1,"baggage":2,"fact":1,"literally":1,"savvy":1,"the":14,"came":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

am a frequent traveler of Spirit Airlines and have been pleased thus far with the service and of course great fares Spirit provides. I am however greatly displeased with the service and lack of communication that was demonstrated to myself and several other passengers during our flight. We arrived to the airport in San Juan early due to departing a cruise ship and upon arrival asked if our seats could be moved closer to the front due to our connection to Las Vegas however all the seats were booked closer. Then the flight time changed to a delay of about 25 minutes which would still have given us enough time to make the connection. Upon the flight landing in San Juan the entire crew had to exit the plane due to mechanical issues from hitting a bird earlier in the day. The flight was then delayed an hour to 5:30pm which certainly would not allow us to make the connection. We went to the gate desk and the agents said to wait 15 minutes for any resolution. We waited 30 with nothing and then they said we are going to board now and arrangements will be made for you in Fort Lauderdale if you miss your connection. Upon boarding the plane at 5pm which was earlier than expected so we may now have a chance to still make our connection. The doors to the plane were shut and the safety briefing was being completed when they stopped and announced they were going to reopen doors and let 3 passengers who missed the boarding announcement to board the plane. This took approximately 20 minutes. After flying the flight attendants did announce to allow for connecting passengers to exit the plane first when we landed at approximately 8:25pm. We thought maybe if we ran with our 3 year old daughter to the other gate we might make our connection flight leaving at 8:40pm. We ran through the terminal to make it by 8:40pm to find that the flight had already departed at 8:33pm which was 7 minutes early. There were several other passengers that missed this flight to Las Vegas. After waiting in line for 30 minutes at the gate counter for some sort of resolution they sent us to the main ticket counter. We ran knowing there was about 20 people behind us and being the 2nd person in line we were not assisted for another hour. After we spoke with Anthony the supervisor at the ticket counter it took him another 20-30 minutes for any resolution as they had \"no idea\" about our issues. We were then told that we were rebooked on another flight to Las Vegas an entire 24 hours later. The time was now 11:30pm and 3 hours after our flight landed in Fort Lauderdale. We were accommodated for the night as well as shuttle to\/from the hotel. The food vouchers we received were not enough to cover our dinner at over $15 a person. We tried asking for an earlier flight with no luck and travelling with our 3 year old and dealing with this was not ideal. The fact is my husband and I both missed work the on Monday and my husband had a huge client he caddies for at the prestigious Shadow Creek making him miss out on over $400 for the one day and I also had my largest customer I missed a meeting with which is unacceptable. On Monday arriving to the airport at 4pm for our 8:40pm flight we found that the airport terminal was evacuated due a burst sprinkler head in baggage claim. We waited outside for over an hour until we were allowed back in the terminal. As soon as we were allowed inside it was Chaos trying to get to the ticket counter as there were hundreds of people. I was able to attain position with my daughter in her stroller with about 20 people in front of me. At the ticket counter it took over an hour to be helped. Once we were helped we were then told we would be charged for our bags. Anthony took care of this for us but the hassle alone has been ridiculous. We made it to the gate with only one hour to spare. \n\n\nSpirit felt that we were compensated since we made it back to our end location and was only willing to credit us $50 each traveler.

Began to argue it but you realized you can't do anything and  that's why it's a crap airline because they know they have you trapped and locked in at that point and can charge you whatever they want it's called extortion?? ...then the guy tells me it's 40 bucks on the way back too??? Wtf ... So for 80 bucks more each (160) I could have went with a real airline and avoided all the stops, tiny seats, could have ate for free, got a pillow and a blanket without having to pay for every little thing...I heard so many people complaining... Even the TSA people were telling people they never use spirit because they are so bad and they know all about the problems.... Even when I was in the bathroom I heard people cursing about spirt saying they would never use them again... Soo on our way back 8 hour delay.... Noting they could do... I got a 7 dollar dinner voucher that could only be used at one place that charges 4 bucks for a water... About 10 bucks for a burger.... Stay away from these guys I hope they disappear soon....

Spirit Airlines,\n\nI tried to complete a customer survey, but, like your planes, the page was not functioning.  I was a passenger aboard flight 1069 from Cleveland to Las Vegas on Sunday, November 13, 2016.  This flight was four hours late, and I am specific because that night there were other Spirt Airlines' flights which were also delayed for several hours.  This delay was due to the fact that there was no plane.  How does an airline company not have a plane?\n\nHowever, the lack of planes was not the only issue.  There is also a definite lack of customer service training.  When I tried to find the flight in Las Vegas, I mistakenly went to the wrong gate.  I asked the Spirit employee if this was the Cleveland flight.  He said, \"do you see Cleveland on the screen?\"  When I stepped in to take a closer look, he said, \"it's not there.  Check out another gate.\"  Apparently, \"sarcasm\" is one of your service methods.  I assume other lessons include \"five lies equal one truth\" and \"glue sniffing is for break time only.\"  Given your propensity to charge for every option including speaking to someone at a desk, I should be thankful I did not have to pay for the lack of assistance I received.\n\n\nOn the Sunday I was to return to Las Vegas, I was sent no less than ten emails telling me that my plan was delayed by a half hour, then an hour, then two hours, then three.  Finally I was sent five emails telling me that by plane would be three and half hours late. When I called to see if I could arrive later given the late departure, I was told no.  I still had to arrive two hours before the original departure even though the flight wasn't going to leave for another six hours.  Your customer services person said, that it was possible that something good could happen.  However, nothing good ever happened.\n\nAt the airport, I was stopped by TSA because my pants had a sag in them.  The agent said he was required to feel my groin.  At every point he would say, \"I am going to rub your crouch.  Are you okay with that?'  All I can say is if our president-elect had been this courteous, maybe we wouldn't look at him as perverted, self-centered, megalomaniac.  I know that you are saying that this was not your responsibility for TSA groping, but I view it as foreplay for what was to come.\n\nWhen I arrived at the gate, the attendant said that they were getting a plane from Fort Meyers, Florida and that it would be only a couple hours. At 8:00 pm, they made announcement that the plane would be here in one hour. About a half hour later, the announcer said that it would be another two hours until the plane arrived.  Did the pilot forget something and have to turn around?  Were they taking a tour?  The plane was empty.  After the periodic lies about when the plane would arrive, the  employee said it was due to \"growing pains.\"  \n\nThe plane did not leave until almost 11:00 pm all because you forgot about Cleveland.  Was this because they lost the World Series?   I think the winner of the World Series should get the right to rename the losing city for the following year.  My choice for a new name for Cleveland would be \"the City where I got screwed by Spirit Airlines.\"\n\nYour motto is \"Less money more go.\" I think this is a misrepresentation.  I would suggest some alternatives: \"Spirit Airlines, Don't have any expectations and you won't be disappointed' or \"If you died and we had to transport your spirit, it still would not have room to sit in our tiny seats.\"   What is with the seats?  In case you have not noticed, your passengers are not thin.  From my only experience with your airline, you seem to appeal to a morbidly obese population.  For the future, might I suggest benches with rings hanging from the ceiling instead.\n\nBy the time it was over, I was hoping that luggage would drop on my head so I would get a concussion and forget the last nine hours of my life.  If I were to name the top three things which is wrong with this country, I would say our lack of universal health care system, our lagging economy, and our inability to address racial issues.  However, if I were to expand that list to twenty flying on Spirit Airlines would certainly make the list.\n\nAt the end, I received a $50 voucher towards another Spirit Airlines flight.  Thank you.  It will come in handy the next time I want to be groped and abused.\n\nSincere","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2016-11-16","useful":6,"counts":{"all":2,"forget":2,"lack":4,"alternatives":1,"four":1,"perverted":1,"hanging":1,"go":1,"issues":1,"certainly":1,"to":29,"finally":1,"include":1,"sent":2,"me":2,"choice":1,"vegas":3,"every":2,"telling":2,"1069":1,"did":3,"list":2,"leave":2,"ten":1,"thin":1,"voucher":1,"functioning":1,"even":1,"n't":4,"what":2,"assistance":1,"new":1,"appeal":1,"ever":1,"spirt":1,"told":1,"crouch":1,"here":1,"hours":9,"following":1,"address":1,"november":1,"passengers":1,"luggage":1,"experience":1,"airport":1,"periodic":1,"survey":1,"from":4,"would":14,"charge":1,"next":1,"until":2,"more":1,"``":11,"company":1,"customer":3,"room":1,"hour":4,"this":8,"nine":1,"can":1,"growing":1,"arrive":3,"my":7,"agent":1,"something":2,"want":1,"11:00":1,"end":1,"sit":1,"six":1,"delay":1,"how":1,"sunday":2,"gate":3,"economy":1,"okay":1,"tried":2,"after":1,"wrong":2,"plane":9,"las":3,"a":17,"maybe":1,"departure":2,"responsibility":1,"suggest":2,"over":1,"top":1,"including":1,"still":2,"before":1,"thank":1,"expectations":1,"tsa":2,"late":3,"2016":1,"might":1,"happened":1,"then":3,"them":1,"someone":1,"return":1,"groping":1,"break":1,"they":4,"half":3,"not":10,"handy":1,"groped":1,"name":2,"lies":2,"drop":1,"sniffing":1,"stopped":1,"truth":1,"went":1,"lagging":1,"due":2,"series":2,"year":1,"our":5,"happen":1,"out":1,"'":3,"announcer":1,"health":1,"got":1,"issue":1,"attendant":1,"care":1,"training":1,"where":1,"could":2,"florida":1,"turn":1,"aboard":1,"sarcasm":1,"think":2,"there":4,"feel":1,"mistakenly":1,"one":3,"another":4,"city":2,"given":2,"service":2,"twenty":1,"concussion":1,"system":1,"pains":1,"megalomaniac":1,"speaking":1,"ceiling":1,"option":1,"that":15,"foreplay":1,"than":1,"population":1,"13":1,"future":1,"were":6,"and":10,"flights":1,"sag":1,"say":3,"have":6,"seem":1,"apparently":1,"any":1,"also":2,"take":1,"which":2,"so":1,"towards":1,"though":1,"plan":1,"nothing":1,"later":2,"fact":1,"saying":1,"rings":1,"find":1,"lessons":1,"winner":1,"should":2,"only":4,"going":2,"employee":2,"fort":1,"do":2,"get":2,"him":1,"courteous":1,"view":1,"see":2,"are":3,"sincere":1,"closer":1,"said":7,"definite":1,"screen":1,"pants":1,"we":2,"wo":1,"self-centered":1,"however":3,"motto":1,"come":2,"received":2,"last":1,"country":1,"taking":1,"equal":1,"tour":1,"asked":1,"point":1,",":43,"airlines":6,"been":1,".":44,"empty":1,"pm":2,"obese":1,"life":1,"flight":6,"spirit":7,"pilot":1,"case":1,"look":2,"will":1,"groin":1,"rename":1,"hoping":1,"almost":1,"is":8,"it":9,"good":2,"in":7,"if":6,"8:00":1,"pay":1,"make":1,"propensity":1,"stepped":1,"several":1,"arrived":2,"two":3,"expand":1,"i":36,"person":1,"services":1,"inability":1,"the":43,"president-elect":1,"things":1,"less":2,"money":1,"seats":2,"glue":1,"announcement":1,"$":1,"had":4,"morbidly":1,"around":1,"couple":1,"possible":1,"five":2,"know":1,"desk":1,"world":2,"disappointed":1,"instead":1,"like":1,"lost":1,"50":1,"specific":1,"night":1,"page":1,"because":4,"methods":1,"some":1,"emails":2,"cleveland":5,"dear":1,"racial":1,"transport":1,"for":11,"does":1,"screwed":1,"?":7,"be":8,"rub":1,"losing":1,"misrepresentation":1,"by":5,"on":5,"about":3,"benches":1,"getting":1,"of":7,"airline":2,"or":1,"three":3,"thankful":1,"right":1,"tiny":1,"your":10,"flying":1,"noticed":1,":":1,"was":23,"head":1,"complete":1,"delayed":2,"but":2,"with":5,"he":4,"abused":1,"made":1,"planes":2,"meyers":1,"called":1,"passenger":1,"universal":1,"forgot":1,"am":2,"an":2,"''":9,"as":2,"at":7,"check":1,"no":3,"when":5,"other":2,"you":9,"'s":1,"died":1,"assume":1,"required":1,"time":3,"original":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

Please do not book a flight with them. They cancel many flights daily and leave you stranded in the departure airport without accommodations. I booked my mom and niece a flights 2 months ago through Expedia . Well today was they departure and first a email was sent that said their flight was delayed 2 hours but still come to the airport 3 hours ahead of your first scheduled departure just in case we decide to leave . So my mom then at the airport is told that the flight was cancelled and without any reason. They were told they have 2 options : 1- reschedule or 2- come back tommorow and check to see if a flights available! No refunds they said! My mother has no ride back from the airport to go home because it's midnight there and my father is at work. My mother is 70 years old and was also told they would not be put up in a hotel.

This airline gives you exactly what they promise to give you. We used Spirit for a quick vacation to Vegas a couple of weeks ago, and got exactly what we expected. Their website makes it incredibly clear that when you buy the tickets, you will be only allowed to bring one personal item onto the flight (perfect if you are only going somewhere for a few days). Their website also makes it incredibly clear that if you want to have some ample legroom, those seats will cost you extra. Oh, and the flight cost was only about half as much as any other flights flying out that weekend, so that was pretty spectacular.\n     Our flight actually arrived to our destinations about 10-15 minutes early both when arriving in Vegas, and when coming back home. The flight crew was pretty friendly, and had a really excellent sarcastic sense of humor, which I love, and thought was fitting for a crowd on their way to a weekend in Vegas.\n     Obviously I understand that Spirit isn't the most ideal airline. They aren't as comfy, and don't offer as many add-ons as other other airlines do.

How could they possibly delay the flight a full night before it's supposed to depart when conditions were perfect? The answer has to be internal scheduling issues because there's no other explanation.  I don't know how any airline could possibly be this bad.\n\nIn neither cases was any drink or food voucher given for my inconvenience.  What's more all messages carry a disclaimer that you should still arrive an hour before the original scheduled time. \n\nReading other reviews online I feel fortunate I arrived at all.

I was a little irritated that the weight limit for check-in bags is 40lbs and if you're over it's $25 extra.  Despite that still an okay experience so far.  \n\nThe employees seemed fairly nice but they provide no snacks or drinks during your flight.  However they do charge for snacks and such and only accept card\/debit.  So there wasn't much interaction with the employees.  But they could work on a script when they are speaking to the passengers on the plane without hesitation or some confidence. \n\nThe flight was horrid!  For some reason I can sleep on flights and including this one surprisingly.

While I don't support being rude to employees, this remark was completely out of line. At 2.30am the pilot announces that the Oakland runway is closed, and that our flight crew is about to time out.

I am not the World's Greatest Flier and am very partial to Alaska Air.  I wanted to cancel my reservation after reading the reviews on here.  I am glad that I didn't!    \n\nThere wasn't a thing wrong with our trip.  We flew  from Portland to Vegas on Feb 15th.  Everyone we came into contact with, from the Rapid Drop Off Baggage Clerk, to the gate attendants and flight attendants, were helpful and friendly.  \n\nThe fees-----the majority of airlines charge fees to check baggage now.  Spirit was comparable, I believe it was $25\/bag and the bag had to weigh 40 pounds or less.   Roll your clothes or watch one of the many videos on You Tube to learn how to pack a lot into a bag. My husband and I packed enough for 4 days in one checked bag.  That included shoes and dress clothes.  I also took a good-sized carry on and a large handbag and did not have any issues.  PLAN AHEAD.  If you don't, it's your own fault, not the fault of the airlines---their fees are not hidden.\n\nWe paid $13 extra (each) for their Big Front Seats.  WELL WORTH THE $$!  Waaaay more leg room and we were not jammed up against each other.  Very comfortable.  I will book these seats again.  It was the most comfortable I have ver been on a plane.\n\nYes, they charge for food\/drinks.  Credit\/Debit only, no cash.  You can buy something from the airport and carry it on, but the price won't be much different.  \n\nThe plane was an Airbus, it seemed in good condition to me.  It was clean.  I am a germophobe and didn't feel like I had to sanitize everything....\n\nThey did change our flight times well in advance--approx 1 hour change each way.\n\nOverall, very good price to Vegas. Decent flights, decent service, nothing fancy, but perfectly adequate.  I will not hesitate to fly Spirit again, as long as the price is less than other airlines.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2012-02-21","useful":0,"counts":{"all":1,"partial":1,"shoes":1,"less":2,"approx":1,"front":1,"flier":1,"seats":2,"yes":1,"food\/drinks":1,"issues":1,"seemed":1,"rapid":1,"ver":1,"$":4,"also":1,"(":1,"had":2,",":16,"spirit":3,"to":12,"charge":2,"other":2,"4":1,"hidden":1,"friendly":1,"do":1,"good":2,"very":3,"big":1,"watch":1,"flew":1,"vegas":2,"they":2,"not":6,"world":1,"now":1,"condition":1,"like":1,"helpful":1,"pounds":1,"--":4,"drop":1,"large":1,"did":4,"bad":1,"each":3,"husband":1,"clothes":2,"everyone":1,"we":4,"up":1,"cancel":1,"alaska":1,"are":1,"good-sized":1,"credit\/debit":1,"our":2,"portland":1,"air":1,"packed":1,"will":2,"for":4,"bag":3,"tube":1,"wrong":1,"everything":1,"enough":1,"contact":1,"reading":2,"15th":1,"be":2,"comparable":1,"leg":1,"wo":1,"clerk":1,"of":3,"here":1,"were":2,"included":1,"nowhere":1,"from":3,"wanted":1,"by":1,"change":2,"on":6,"feb":1,"would":1,"ahead":1,"fault":2,"days":1,"against":1,"times":1,"thing":1,"airport":1,"or":2,"own":1,"extra":1,"feel":1,"into":2,"fancy":1,"one":2,"handbag":1,"jammed":1,"been":1,"fees":3,"carry":2,"your":2,"airbus":1,"checked":1,"videos":1,"service":1,"decent":2,"there":1,"25\/bag":1,"long":1,".":29,"their":1,"much":1,"lot":1,"perfectly":1,"was":7,"more":1,"attendants":2,"only":1,"flight":2,"way":1,"advance":1,"fly":1,"took":1,"but":2,"-their":1,"believe":1,"with":2,"than":1,"glad":1,"me":1,"majority":1,"13":1,"terrible":1,"room":1,"hour":1,"sanitize":1,"these":1,"cash":1,"worth":1,"reviews":2,"near":1,"can":1,"learn":1,"my":3,"pack":1,"and":11,"flights":1,"waaaay":1,"...":1,"is":1,"am":4,"it":7,"an":1,"n't":5,"as":4,"buy":1,"something":1,"have":2,"in":3,"dress":1,"trip":2,"worry":1,"if":1,"!":2,"again":2,"different":1,"comfortable":2,"no":1,")":1,"that":2,"40":1,"check":1,"1":1,"how":1,"-the":1,"book":1,"airlines":3,"gate":1,"you":3,"many":1,"roll":1,"'s":2,"hesitate":1,"any":1,"overall":1,"price":3,"after":2,"paid":1,"germophobe":1,"most":1,"generated":1,"plane":2,"plan":1,"nothing":1,"reservation":1,"a":7,"off":1,"i":13,"well":2,"thought":1,"baggage":2,"adequate":1,"greatest":1,"clean":1,"weigh":1,"the":17,"came":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

I cannot fathom how much it hurts me to even give Spirit Airlines one star. They don't deserve a single star to begin with. Spirit does not provide their customers with the slightest sympathy, profit is really what it's about. Not a single breath given to their fliers, but I guess that's what happens when you fly on a budget--right? No, wrong. There are no words to describe how I feel about this airline and their lack of commitment, loyalty, communication and lastly quality service. \n\nI had a flight leaving Las Vegas at 4:10PM which wan delayed due to late take off from a departing city--I get that. Don't get me wrong, going forward my flight was delayed once again when the plane had arrive due to a severe weather advisory. Also understandable. The very last delay lasted about an hour or so, stating that there were mechanical issues with the aircraft. Ok, ok--you're right, why wouldn't I hesitate boarding on an unsafe aircraft? Of course I did, but arriving to my destination was the most important outcome. From 4pm to 9pm, Spirit decided to cancel the flight leaving LAS to San Diego to Portland. Creating an inconvenience to hundreds of travelers crammed into their tiny airbus carrier. Yes--budget means lack of space, but it also means extremely upset individuals. Leaving the gate to the front kiosk where Spirit claims to provide accommodations for all guest, they shorted over 300 individuals. Only providing the options of a refund or a flight the next day with absolutely NO lodging compensation. Why is that you ask? Oh it was because they decided to lie about what they had expressed during the final delay. I was told that there wasn't a mechanical issue--though it was announced several times, that there was bad air traffic and the weather did not permit departure. Sure, that's a great reason to rip us all of. I just don't understand why they presented the mechanical issue as such a dire situation to delay departure and then lie to protect themselves of accommodating hundreds of guest. Yes, my round trip flight may have been $250, but please spring $50 for a hotel next time you decide to delay my flight 5 hours and cancel as a result. \n\nLong story short, don't fly spirit. No flight, continue to fight. Don't let spirit ruin your travel plans with their lack of consistency, communication skills and quality service.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-08-19","useful":2,"counts":{"refund":1,"advisory":1,"all":2,"they":5,"just":1,"departing":1,"over":1,"lack":3,"accommodations":1,"course":1,"yes":2,"issues":1,"$":2,"how":2,"front":1,"ruin":1,"had":3,",":20,"late":1,"to":20,"only":1,"going":1,"communication":2,"skills":1,"take":1,"then":1,"customers":1,"get":2,"very":1,"vegas":1,"traffic":1,"words":1,"not":4,"during":1,"day":1,"presented":1,"--":5,"plane":1,"50":1,"did":2,"bad":1,"individuals":2,"?":3,"4:10pm":1,"where":1,"round":1,"9pm":1,"right":2,"absolutely":1,"spring":1,"decided":2,"are":1,"'s":3,"portland":1,"guess":1,"really":1,"even":1,"what":3,"lastly":1,"for":2,"space":1,"profit":1,"arriving":1,"wow":1,"please":1,"fathom":1,"expressed":1,"hesitate":1,"does":1,"arrive":1,"issue":2,"announced":1,"told":1,"inconvenience":1,"creating":1,"wan":1,"300":1,"were":1,"story":1,"hundreds":2,"hours":1,"aircraft":2,"let":1,"dire":1,"hurts":1,"ask":1,"lasted":1,"on":2,"protect":1,"outcome":1,"last":1,"service":2,"oh":1,"of":9,"reason":1,"leaving":3,"carrier":1,"airline":1,"permit":1,"or":2,"there":4,"feel":1,"travelers":1,"into":1,"commitment":1,"one":1,"sympathy":1,"weather":2,"long":1,"lodging":1,"cancel":2,"250":1,"next":2,"quality":2,"your":1,"airbus":1,"city":1,"crammed":1,"stating":1,"from":2,"guest":2,"would":1,"destination":1,"due":2,"been":1,"fight":1,"breath":1,"their":5,"again":1,"much":1,"forward":1,"themselves":1,"was":7,"final":1,"diego":1,"flight":7,"continue":1,"that":7,"great":1,"hotel":1,"kiosk":1,"about":4,"but":4,"understandable":1,"ok":2,"given":1,"with":5,"spirit":6,"me":2,"boarding":1,"claims":1,"hour":1,"this":1,"fliers":1,"budget":2,"us":1,"air":1,"n't":7,"compensation":1,"'re":1,"can":1,".":24,"situation":1,"providing":1,"my":4,"slightest":1,"result":1,"and":6,"san":1,"do":5,"is":2,"describe":1,"unsafe":1,"it":5,"rip":1,"an":3,"fly":2,"single":2,"tiny":1,"at":1,"have":1,"times":1,"decide":1,"trip":1,"as":2,"lie":2,"because":1,"shorted":1,"no":4,"provide":2,"deserve":1,"travel":1,"means":2,"when":2,"off":1,"delay":4,"also":2,"5":1,"airlines":1,"which":1,"gate":1,"you":4,"several":1,"happens":1,"begin":1,"sure":1,"star":2,"plans":1,"though":1,"may":1,"time":1,"loyalty":1,"delayed":2,"most":1,"wrong":2,"important":1,"mechanical":3,"such":1,"extremely":1,"why":3,"las":2,"a":13,"short":1,"give":1,"i":9,"upset":1,"departure":2,"options":1,"severe":1,"so":1,"consistency":1,"understand":1,"the":13,"accommodating":1,"4pm":1,"once":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

I was very hesitant to book due to the bad reviews all over the internet but most complaints were about baggage fees.  They clearly state what the fees are so I'm not sure why people are surprised.  Luckily we were only going for 3 days so I just shipped my stuff home and shipped back to avoid the fee.  The rate was almost $200 per ticket cheaper so even if we would've paid the $60 it still would have come out cheaper.  We opted to not pay for the seats because we really do not care.  Glad we didn't because on both flights, I ended up with a row to myself!! Both times I returned back to Vegas on a Saturday and the flights are only about half full.  I do recommend if you are a heavier set person to purchase the bigger seats so that you and the person you are sitting next to are comfortable.  I had a fairly larger man in the window seat, I was in the middle and someone was on the aisle.  I was so smooshed and he was clearly uncomfortable as well.  And on my flight returning to Vegas, the plane was dirty.  You could clearly see crumbs underneath my original seat.  Kinda gross!\nFlight in April going to Ohio, the seats felt like I was sitting on a bleacher at a high school football game.  It was horrible.  But all other flights, the seats were cushioned ok.  The rows are kind of small but hey I'll take that for $200 less.\nI'm not sure I would fly in the winter because they seem to have a ton of complaints about being able to put delayed passengers on a new flight however I'm also seeing recent passengers w flight delays so not sure.

Departure time was to be at 6am but our flight was delayed until 6:50am and we were able to board then. A few minutes after we boarded, we had to in-board. Our flight was delayed again until 9am, again until 10am and the final delay until noon. By that time they decided to cancel the flight. To find out, that plane had been grounded since the night before. We stood in line at the Spirit airlines counter for 3 hours for them to finally decide to route everyone to new flights with different airlines. One guy got on the phone with a customer care agent and was able to get a new flight without having to wait in line so long so he told everyone to start calling while standing in line. We all started calling. These customer care agents and the supervisors did not speak English well and it was hard to understand them. Some people were told Spirit airlines doesn't re-route flights with a different airline but they would be able to book a flight Sunday night to Vegas since that's when the next flight for them would be. Other people were lucky and were able to get a different flight with another airline. Not sure why there was a difference but we were one of the unlucky ones and had to wait in line. We finally were routed to Delta Airlines. We were going to Vegas for the Superbowl but one unlucky couple missed a special moment wedding because of Spirit Airlines' incompetence. Very disappointed with how Spirit Airlines handled this and I will never be a customer of theirs again. If it were up to me I would give them 0 stars but unfortunately Yelp makes you select at the lowest 1 star.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2016-02-07","useful":0,"counts":{"all":1,"they":2,"able":4,"wedding":1,"customer":3,"find":1,"before":1,"1":1,"grounded":1,"had":3,",":3,"0":1,"finally":2,"going":1,"board":1,"then":1,"them":4,"re-route":1,"get":2,"very":1,"couple":1,"lucky":1,"supervisors":1,"ones":1,"decide":1,"new":2,"not":2,"difference":1,"disappointed":1,"did":1,"calling":2,"these":1,"night":2,"guy":1,"boarded":1,"in-board":1,"everyone":2,"people":2,"hard":1,"some":1,"decided":1,"our":2,"special":1,"out":1,"n't":1,"stood":1,"missed":1,"for":4,"noon":1,"since":2,"3":1,"does":1,"horrible":1,"got":1,"told":2,"be":4,"we":8,"after":1,"never":1,"hours":1,"by":1,"care":2,"on":1,"6am":1,"of":3,"route":1,"'s":1,"routed":1,"airline":3,"makes":1,"book":1,"superbowl":1,"final":1,"one":3,"because":1,"agents":1,"been":1,"another":1,"cancel":1,".":16,"select":1,"speak":1,"standing":1,"handled":1,"would":3,"to":19,"there":1,"airlines":6,"long":1,"next":1,"few":1,"stars":1,"time":2,"wait":2,"was":6,"start":1,"lowest":1,"flight":7,"that":3,"started":1,"delayed":2,"but":5,"phone":1,"understand":1,"delta":1,"line":4,"with":5,"spirit":4,"he":1,"me":1,"unfortunately":1,"this":1,"up":1,"until":4,"will":1,"while":1,"delay":1,"were":8,"minutes":1,"and":8,"flights":2,"give":1,"it":2,"agent":1,"at":3,"in":4,"if":1,"!":3,"again":3,"different":3,"when":1,"unlucky":2,"how":1,"sunday":1,"other":1,"you":1,"sure":1,"star":1,"incompetence":1,"6:50am":1,"moment":1,"plane":1,"why":1,"a":9,"theirs":1,"'":1,"yelp":1,"i":2,"counter":1,"well":1,"departure":1,"without":1,"9am":1,"10am":1,"vegas":2,"so":2,"english":1,"the":10,"having":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

The plane crew was also relatively chill and friendly.\n\nLike other reviewers here, I don't feel sorry for the people that complain about the \"hidden fees,\" they tell you everything up front when you book the ticket online. There's a charge for a carry-on and checked bag and if you want someone to check you in at the airport, you would have to pay for that too. Carry-on and personal item are two different things that some people can't seem to get. Basically anything that looks like a small luggage would be considered a carry-on even if it fits into their little display. I got away with a small camelbak that carriied my laptop. Anyway, for a 1 hr flight from Vegas to SD, it's really not that bad even with the not so comfy seats. It felt like we were only flying for maybe 15 minutes before the pilot made the announcement that we're starting our initial descending.

Our flight was delayed over an hour - what made matters worse is that attendant at he desk near the gate never really told a lot of the folks expecting to go to Oakland on time that their was delay and the announcements over the loud speakers kept telling us we were still on time for Oakland - guess what a lot of people for Oakland start trying to board the Chicago flight - not good. Finally get on the right flight - arrived to my seat which I paid more for and found that someone had broken an ink pen and smeared ink all over the seat - did not look like the seat had been cleaned - I was not offered another seat - I had to scrounge around and find something to place over the seat so I could sit down and not ruin my pants - never again Spirit - dirty planes, delays all the time from what I heard from other passengers.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-02-22","useful":1,"counts":{"all":4,"45":1,"just":1,"being":1,"money":1,"over":6,"move":1,"not":4,"seats":1,"go":1,"still":2,"fine":1,"find":1,"before":1,"ruin":1,"had":3,",":3,"to":11,"finally":1,"board":1,"folks":1,"good":1,"worse":1,"get":1,"matters":1,"vegas":1,"desk":1,"telling":1,"using":1,"bit":1,"like":1,"did":1,"worries":1,"found":1,"went":1,"told":3,"out":1,"right":1,"people":1,"seat":5,"are":2,"home":1,"drinks":1,"even":1,"what":3,"hoofed":1,"for":5,"chicago":2,"saved":1,"pen":1,"new":1,"?":1,"pants":1,"gate":5,"we":3,"never":2,"broken":1,"were":1,"wtf":1,"attendant":1,"by":1,"on":5,"last":1,"luggage":1,"of":3,"could":1,"scrounge":1,"etc":1,"expecting":1,"loud":1,"delays":1,"first":1,"extra":1,"down":1,"another":2,"oakland":4,"guess":1,"from":3,"their":1,"been":1,"next":1,"start":1,"lot":2,"taken":1,"was":6,"more":1,"smeared":1,"waiting":1,"flight":7,"passengers":1,"offered":1,"delayed":1,"worked":1,"trying":1,"with":1,"spirit":2,"he":1,"made":1,"look":1,"hour":1,"this":1,"us":1,"i":7,"near":1,"dirty":1,"planes":1,"problem":2,"arrive":1,"my":3,"at":3,"and":8,"is":2,"ink":2,"it":2,"an":2,"heard":1,"someone":1,"something":1,"cleaned":1,"trip":1,"around":1,"again":1,"speakers":1,"no":2,"that":3,"-":18,"delay":1,".":5,"other":1,"which":1,"announcements":1,"really":1,"our":2,"paid":1,"plane":1,"arrived":2,"why":1,"a":3,"kept":1,"charges":1,"sit":1,"well":1,"departure":1,"so":1,"place":1,"time":5,"the":15},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

Hair and garbage in the plane's lavatory sink drain (& I was the first to use on our flight.) Eww. Hey, stewardess, maybe get off your phone and earn your flight attendant title by actually doing your tasks. \n\nThere was an ashtray in the bathroom door, too. Am I on the retro vintage antique throwback flight?? :-P The gate attendants and flight crew rushed us all on to the plane, knowing they had to wait to complete some paperwork before take off to follow safety procedures...(I think that is a good thing?)...\nAfter waiting (through three delays) for just under 5 hrs, I find it difficult to comprehend why we need to sit and wait all confined in a tiny plane for another hour an a half on the tarmac.  These repeated delays really suck when you only see your relatives annually, and you have to drive 3 hrs to the airport. (What I wouldn't give to have all these hours waiting at the airport on delays to spend with my mum!)\n\nCurrently \"enjoying\" another 12 hrs at my layover airport before going home. Thanks to the delays I got to sleep on the airport floor waiting for the next flight tomorrow.  Not sure what Spirit could do aside from put me up at a hotel for the night, which is not on the bare essentials airline budget to do for everyone I imagine, haha.\n\nI realized that if you have somewhere you actually want to go, and want to be there the day you expect to, probably fly on another airline. If your schedule and sanity permits delays as a routine airline operating procedure, you can save money flying Spirit. (What is the structurally logistical issue, Spirit? Really, though.) \n\nIf you have checked luggage, it might also be cheaper to fly another airline. The savings on Spirit are more for the bare minimum luggage, flexible schedule, and\/or low expectation traveler.\n\nWe also realized that even though the flights were WAY cheaper from Oakland Airport, our travel cost to get there vs SFO or San Jose reduced the overall travel cost savings.\n\nBumping to a three because the pilot had a great landing. What's more, this other pilot waiting for his plane at LAS initiated a genuinely friendly conversation about my journey and experience traveling today. I politely explained and he wished me well. These are the little touches that balance out the bad. Every airline has their good and bads- price, service, amenities, etc. \n\nThe conclusion on my first Spirit experience is that it's nice to have Spirit as an option, when price is the biggest factor that trip.  Also, drink wayyyy more next time I need to take an evening or red eye flight. ^-^","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2016-02-26","useful":1,"counts":{"all":3,"politely":1,"just":1,"from":2,"money":1,"not":2,"through":1,"thanks":1,"go":1,"follow":1,"find":1,"before":2,"jose":1,"touches":1,"essentials":1,"title":1,"somewhere":1,"(":5,"delays":6,"had":2,"already..finally":1,"hrs":3,"crew":1,"to":22,"only":1,"going":1,"-p":1,"door":1,"under":1,"enjoying":1,"might":1,"friendly":1,"take":2,"...":2,"good":2,"wished":1,"get":3,"overall":1,"expectation":1,"cheaper":2,"^-^":1,"12":1,"every":1,"difficult":1,"they":1,"half":1,"confined":1,"now":1,"procedures":1,"day":1,"earn":1,"ashtray":1,"off":2,"sanity":1,"these":3,"bad":1,"?":4,"pilot":2,"night":1,"sleep":1,"conclusion":1,"out":1,"reduced":1,"antique":1,"everyone":1,"doing":1,"some":1,"up":1,"hair":1,"see":1,"cost":2,"bare":2,"expect":1,"layover":1,"our":2,"really":2,"even":1,"annually":1,"what":4,"and\/or":1,"for":7,"currently":1,"use":1,"your":5,"tarmac":1,"waiting":4,"safety":1,"retro":1,"comprehend":1,"routine":1,"mum":1,"got":1,"issue":1,"red":1,"knowing":1,"be":2,"we":2,"after":1,"schedule":2,"structurally":1,"bumping":1,"bathroom":1,"hours":1,"operating":1,"sink":1,"imagine":1,"throwback":1,"checked":1,"attendant":1,"by":1,"wait":2,"on":11,"great":1,"would":1,"luggage":2,"stewardess":1,"could":1,"rushed":1,"experience":2,"conversation":1,"airport":5,"plane":5,"airline":5,"logistical":1,"think":1,"first":2,"tasks":1,"garbage":1,"explained":1,"three":3,"put":1,"lavatory":1,"because":1,"another":4,"traveler":1,"oakland":1,"tomorrow":1,"traveling":1,"save":1,"little":1,"eye":1,"service":1,"&":1,"there":3,"hey":1,"tiny":1,"next":2,"their":1,"amenities":1,"too":1,"way":1,"biggest":1,"flexible":1,":":1,"was":2,"today":1,"more":3,"attendants":1,"``":1,"paperwork":1,"option":1,"initiated":1,"that":6,"flying":1,"hotel":1,"haha":1,"about":1,"landing":1,"phone":1,"repeated":1,"probably":1,"with":1,"spirit":6,"he":1,"me":2,"also":3,"has":1,"have":5,"hour":1,"permits":1,"this":1,"etc":1,"budget":1,"us":1,"n't":1,"vs":1,"can":1,"were":1,"balance":1,"my":4,"procedure":1,"are":2,"and":10,"his":1,"flights":1,"san":1,"factor":1,"do":2,"bads-":1,"is":5,"in":3,"am":1,"it":3,"an":4,"''":1,"fly":2,"as":2,"evening":1,"at":4,"want":2,"home":1,"need":2,"flight":6,"trip":1,"wayyyy":1,"complete":1,"!":1,"thing":1,")":5,"vintage":1,"travel":2,"when":2,"aside":1,",":23,".":23,"relatives":1,"other":1,"5":1,"low":1,"which":1,"gate":1,"you":7,"if":3,"eww":1,"nice":1,"sure":1,"'s":3,"though":2,"price":2,"drink":1,"minimum":1,"3":1,"sfo":1,"journey":1,"floor":1,"suck":1,"why":1,"las":1,"a":8,"realized":2,"drain":1,"give":1,"i":10,"maybe":1,"actually":2,"sit":1,"well":1,"drive":1,"or":2,"savings":2,"time":1,"the":26,"genuinely":1,"spend":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

Ok one star because of \"how cheap the flight was\" blah blah blah. But my experience with this airline and their staff was something created in the 7th layer of hell. \n\nThe night before we went to check in only to encounter multiple glitches in the website. We tried to purchase our checked bags and it kept reverting to the main page or tried to have us put in credit information again after already pressing submit. I actually don't know if we managed to get checked in or not. That's how bad the website was acting up. \n\nGet to the airport only to realize none of our check ins were saved and no record of the bags being paid for. We had to pay the desk check in price, even though we put in card info on the computer for the cheaper price. The reps response: \"most of the people that fly with us take screen shots of all their transactions because they don't always save.\" So they acknowledge the glitch in the system yet refuse to fix the website errors and somehow we were supposed to know to take a screen shot to prove that we weren't lying. We then get our boarding passes,  only to realize the woman printed 2 of the same person. We get to the gate and are told that there was now 3 hour delay due to a plane being stalled in Houston. We received no email, phone call, or even a text message telling us of the change. So we sat around for 3 hours, with no compensation offered, not even a free water on the plane ride. \n\nAs my sister checked in the night before she realized that her flight home, that she had previously changed and received a confirmation code,  had been reverted to the 1st flight. She needed a later flight. So after 2 days of phone calls during our trip, and a few hours spent on telling the airline that the glitch in their system is not her fault, multiple times of the customer service reps hanging up on my sister, telling her that there's room on the flight then there wasn't room on the flight (?), she was FINALLY put onto the flight that she needed thanks to a one minute phone call with a rep named Marvin that swapped her flight no questions asked. (Thank you Marvin!) Apparently it's against company policy to treat their clients with respect and take responsibility for the poor website design. \n\nSo far the plane is on time for our trip home, but the employees here are incredibly rude.\n\nSave yourself the time, energy, and pain this airline causes and fly southwest. By the time you rack up your baggage fees, seat fees, fees to change your flight, fees for breathing on the plane, you'd be paying the price for a southwest flight but you'll have much better service from the airline and staff.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2015-08-23","useful":6,"counts":{"houston":1,"all":1,"code":1,"managed":1,"being":2,"text":1,"cheap":1,"telling":3,"thanks":1,"questions":1,"hanging":1,"hell":1,"saved":1,"yet":1,"causes":1,"staff":2,"now":1,"thank":1,"acknowledge":1,"(":2,"fix":1,"had":3,",":19,"reverting":1,"better":1,"to":20,"only":3,"minute":1,"stalled":1,"policy":1,"main":1,"reverted":1,"southwest":2,"then":2,"woman":1,"so":4,"around":1,"get":4,"far":1,"reps":2,"cheaper":1,"know":2,"they":2,"desk":1,"not":3,"during":1,"glitches":1,"realize":2,"encounter":1,"always":1,"bad":1,"she":5,"shots":1,"night":2,"went":1,"page":1,"system":2,"because":2,"people":1,"energy":1,"1st":1,"somehow":1,"seat":1,"computer":1,"design":1,"are":2,"7th":1,"multiple":2,"even":3,"errors":1,"for":7,"rep":1,"transactions":1,"acting":1,"before":2,"email":1,"?":2,"told":1,"be":1,"we":11,"marvin":2,"screen":2,"were":3,"free":1,"hours":2,"here":1,"response":1,"put":3,"checked":3,"by":1,"card":1,"on":8,"sister":2,"ok":1,"her":4,"created":1,"fault":1,"employees":1,"changed":1,"days":1,"experience":1,"times":1,"credit":1,"airport":1,"plane":4,"airline":4,"onto":1,"or":3,"info":1,"named":1,"already":1,"sat":1,"swapped":1,"previously":1,"bags":2,"one":2,"glitch":2,"submit":1,"fees":4,"respect":1,"message":1,"actually":1,"your":2,"yourself":1,"passes":1,"from":1,"service":2,"prove":1,"there":3,"finally":1,"been":1,".":21,"few":1,"much":1,"call":2,"change":2,"stars":1,":":1,"'s":3,"treat":1,"website":4,"a":10,"``":2,"flight":10,"that":10,"with":5,"offered":1,"star":1,"refuse":1,"but":3,"phone":3,"kept":1,"customer":1,"paying":1,"boarding":1,"none":1,"save":2,"room":2,"hour":1,"blah":3,"this":2,"was":6,"ride":1,"clients":1,"up":3,"us":3,"rack":1,"n't":4,"record":1,"compensation":1,"pressing":1,"supposed":1,"of":10,"my":3,"something":1,"and":11,"due":1,"layer":1,"person":1,"do":2,"can":1,"is":2,"received":2,"it":2,"ins":1,"''":2,"fly":2,"as":1,"breathing":1,"against":1,"have":2,"home":2,"apparently":1,"their":4,"if":1,"!":1,"again":1,"confirmation":1,"'ll":1,"in":11,"no":5,")":2,"pay":1,"shot":1,"water":1,"same":1,"check":3,"delay":1,"how":2,"take":3,"gate":1,"you":4,"incredibly":1,"company":1,"poor":1,"trip":2,"pain":1,"tried":2,"rude":1,"though":1,"our":5,"price":3,"after":2,"paid":1,"3":2,"most":1,"'d":1,"printed":1,"information":1,"needed":2,"2":2,"purchase":1,"realized":1,"give":1,"calls":1,"i":2,"later":1,"spent":1,"asked":1,"baggage":1,"responsibility":1,"time":3,"the":37,"lying":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

I used Travelocity to book a flight out to Vegas for a business trip.  This was the only flight with the times I needed so I booked it.  I didn't think it was all that great a deal either. And Travelocity didn't warn about all the fees you will incur when you do check in with Spirit (which I really think they should do since they aren't like other airlines). \n\nI'm pretty sure if you sneezed and asked for a tissue, a flight attendant would charge you for it.  I am a really anxious flier, so for me I need to sit in the window and see what's happening.  I checked in like I would with any flight to pick my seat, and if you want to actually choose your seat you pay at least $18 for it.  Otherwise you can let them assign you and maybe you won't be shoved in the middle.  I don't like this, no other airline does this.  It's a rip off.  Bags were also a few dollars more, and the weight limit is 10 lbs. less than every other airline.  Strike two.  Between picking a normal seat (nothing special...and don't expect leg room) and checking my bags it was about $100 extra.  What a rip off.  Oh, and if you want to carry-on instead of checking, you will pay about $100, so don't waste your money.  They will find a way to make you pay. They also destroyed my luggage, and this suitcase is pretty indestructible.\n\nThe leg room is non-existent, and you feel like you are riding a greyhound in the sky.

What can you really expect from an airline that charges you $40 round trip before taxes?  If you're expecting the red carpet treatment or even just same amenities as the other airlines, you're out of your damn mind.  It is true that you get what you pay for.  You want more leg room, pay for it.  You want a more comfortable seat, pay for it.  You want a plane not to smell like baby poop, THEN PAY FOR IT.  I worked for an airline once upon a time so I guess I'm biased.\n\nWith that being said HOLY CR*P is this plane ghetto!!!!!  My butt falls asleep every time I fly on Spirit and mind you I only fly for an hour and a half every time.  It's really annoying that they charge you for everything but again, look how much you paid for your flight. I can say the ticket counter people are nice in OAK and horrible in LAS.  I had this one Latin ***** who wasn't helpful at all when I left important documents on the plane. She called down to the plane ONCE and asked them nonchalantly to look for my folder. I asked her to call again and even begged for a gate pass.  I was crying my eyes out because I knew I left them in the seat pocket in front of my seat and she made it seem like someone took them and they were gone forever.  I walked in to baggage to make a lost and found claim and the baggage agent ran to the plane and found my folder. WHAT AN AWESOME HUMAN BEING and the epitome of a good employee.

When my cousin decided she wanted to move to his vacated seat, which was on the row of seats right across from myself and my cousin she took the seat right next to my mother and sister and a caucasian flight attendant who looked to be in her mid twenties decided that she couldn't because it may cause a weight imbalance. \n\nAs unlikely as that sounded my cousin decided to follow direction and take her old seat. Now, afterwards when an african american woman wanted to take another empty row for some extra room and was turned away as well. \n\nThis was rather strange seeing as the man had gotten his extra elbow room but my cousin and another person of color were denied the same request? That doesn't seem right doesn't it? \n\nAs the flight went on a phone went off and another flight attendant, an african american man in his early twenties thought it was my mothers phone that went off. \n\nNow normally I'd see this as a mistake and nothing more but I heard him smugly remark \"always blame the asians\" to everyone and I truly mean everyone on the flight like an announcement.\n\nThis is my mother being disrespected. You think I didn't get angry? No, I was, and the only damn reason I didn't take care of the matter right then and there was because, violence on a plane, where other people not involved could get hurt, is wrong.   \n\nSo here I am writing the alternative, \nAnd you know whats the best damn part?\n\nAs my family is walking down the aisle I keep hearing the workers whisper the word \"Chinitos\"\nWhich means Asians in spanish. \n\nMostly coming from this elderly hispanic woman that looked rather decrepit and withered to this latino man whom looked to be in his mid to late twenties with tattoos on his arm.   \n\nAnd I see alot of eyes on my family like we're not even human, like we don't belong on this flight because we're asian. \n\nYou want to go on this flight?

He booked a trip from LAS through FLL to BOS for a Christian Sports Camp. Although he is excited to go, but all the excitement is gone when at 1st his flight is posponed from 11:10pm until 3:30am, and then later cancelled. I wanted to make sure that his flight was not the reason that he missed the camp. So I told my son that this is one of those things, and it can't happen 2x (on the return flight). I had him get a refund, and we rebooked with US Air for an extra $125.00 because it was so late to aquiring tickets, and in the end, he was a few hours late arriving in Boston, but he made his camp. Anyway, today on his return flight. (6\/29) and Anti Spirit again was 3 hours late arriving in Boston from Atlantic City, therefore meaning that he could not connect in Dallas for his flight back to Las vegas. We were floored and amazed. They did put him up overnight, but because the flight was so late in arriving in Dallas, there was no available shuttle, so it cost him to take a cab and got to bed at 2 am. This is a really bad, unreliable airline and they cannot be trusted or depended upon. If you absolutely must be someplace, DO NOT depend on Anti Spirit Airlines. \nOh - OMT - the whole time, my son had the feeling that nobody is really in charge, and are apathatic to the distress that are caused by their ineptitude. STAY AWAY!

i go to the other gate and chat with tsa guards, and 4 of them tell me they would never fly this airline and they hear the worst horror stories, maintainence supervisors not caring about details and predatory pricing and bait and switch small print disclosers. the real concern is the employee moral is so bad that the maintainence employees don't really care if the plane is safe. this airline is not safe due do employee moral and lack of empowerment from management, i have been traveling for 30 years and have never missed a flight-the same thing happened on the return flight! the lv supervisor told me to get out of my face when i asked why are you charging me 18 when i paid for the 9 dollar club etc. he stormed off and told me your will never fly spirit again, so my lady friend goes back to desk a few minutes later with the same ticket and now told its 150 to change flight!! then i call and they change flight for 23 dollars when the web site say changes within 24 hours are free.the employees don't care and hate there jobs which is a safety concern! don't' not fly this airline it is not safe because the rules create low moral of i don't care i'm just here for a paycheck and take the abuse from ignorant management policies. this airline will fail only after they cycle through all the suckers and the public really knows the risk of flying the unsafe airline. southwest employee culture of attempting to solve passenger problems is worth the extra money, denied boarding twice in 2 days with no refunds!

We checked one under 40 pound bag before hand, printed our boarding passes and made sure our personal items were within guidelines.  We also ate and drank before hand and were prepared.\n\nThe flight to Vegas was fine and uneventful.  We walked right up to the bag drop and were done at the counter in under 2 minutes.  Which never happens.\n\nThe seats are a bit tight - not something I really noticed but I am 5'4\" and petite, but my fiance is over 6' and was cramped.  He is also a Diamond Delta flyer and I reminded him this is not Delta.\n\nWhen we checked in for the return flight, we saw online the flight was delayed by almost an hour and a half.  We did this about 4 hours before our flight so again, we were able to adjust our day.  When we checked back it had been delayed another 30 minutes.  So final delay was two hours from original departure time.\n\nNo other issues with the flight home.  The staff at both airports and on both flights were very friendly and we had no complaints.\n\nI would fly Spirit again IF there is a significant price difference - like $100 or more, otherwise, I would not be hesitant to fly them again if the savings is worth it.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2013-08-13","useful":0,"counts":{"all":1,"reminded":1,"over":1,"through":1,"seats":1,"fine":1,"issues":1,"before":3,"$":1,"also":2,"personal":1,"nervous":1,"had":2,",":11,"day":1,"to":6,"only":1,"4":1,"under":2,"5'4":1,"friendly":1,"do":1,"them":1,"good":1,"return":1,"very":2,"familiar":1,"process":1,"vegas":2,"uneventful":1,"half":1,"not":3,"2":2,"bit":1,"difference":1,"him":1,"reading":1,"airports":1,"like":1,"did":2,"drop":1,"bag":2,"adjust":1,"right":1,"deal":1,"guidelines":1,"back":1,"expect":1,"our":6,"really":1,"happens":1,"n't":1,"what":2,"for":3,"nightmare":1,"research":1,"horrible":1,"staff":1,"booking":1,"be":1,"we":9,"knew":1,"assured":1,"never":1,"hours":2,"flyer":1,"checked":3,"100":1,"prepared":1,"by":1,"on":2,"about":3,"ate":1,"hesitant":1,"fiance":1,"items":1,"30":1,"experience":1,"keep":1,"fiancee":1,"or":1,"otherwise":1,"within":1,"one":1,"pound":1,"done":1,"another":1,"fees":1,".":18,"passes":1,"from":1,"would":2,"there":1,"two":1,"been":1,"noticed":1,"-":3,"their":2,"drank":1,"6":1,"was":8,"final":1,"more":1,"diamond":1,"flight":7,"both":2,"mind":1,"hotel":1,"delayed":2,"but":2,"it":7,"delta":2,"with":2,"spirit":2,"he":1,"me":1,"boarding":1,"made":1,"hour":2,"this":2,"when":2,"etc":1,"up":1,"worth":1,"reviews":1,"were":5,"my":3,"are":1,"and":16,"flights":1,"then":1,"almost":1,"minutes":2,"is":7,"in":3,"am":1,"site":1,"an":1,"''":1,"fly":2,"something":1,"home":1,"ready":1,"saw":1,"trip":2,"worry":1,"if":2,"again":3,"no":2,"able":1,"40":1,"delay":1,"tight":1,"other":1,"which":1,"online":1,"sure":1,"petite":1,"price":1,"after":1,"hand":2,"printed":1,"significant":1,"complaints":1,"a":7,"'":1,"i":8,"counter":1,"departure":1,"walked":1,"savings":1,"cramped":1,"so":3,"time":1,"at":2,"the":10,"original":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

aren't seeing double: I give Spirit a hearty four stars, and I've been flying regularly since I was a tot, forty-odd years ago. (You know, back when Kindergarteners could fly unaccompanied, wearing shorts on the plane was seen as questionably casual, and though we all kvetched about the food, at least we had some!)\n\nMany of those who complain about Spirit across the Internet do so because they don't like the business model. But is that fair? Do we expect silk gowns from Target or organic veggie burgers from McDonald's? Every amenity at Spirit is a la carte. Know it. Accept it. Embrace it. Then you might fly happy. \n\nWhere it *is* fair to dock stars is for grotty plans and flight attendants who chat with each other at full volume at the front of the plane during a red-eye flight. (The last has only happened once, but the Airbus 319s are always somewhat tired and grim-looking.)\n\nAll of this said, you have to go into Spirit with your eyes open. Read all of the rules. Comparison shop. It's not for everyone, especially if you travel heavy, but here's why it's AMAZING for me: \n\nThe \"Big Front Seat.\" \n\nI'm a big gal. When my husband (almost as round as me, plus he has a pair of long legs on that 6' 4\" frame) flies with me, we just buy up the whole row if we're not in an MD-80. Technically we can wedge ourselves into regular seats without bothering others, and that look of fear that passes over faces as we bob down the aisle IS kind of fun, but flying is a dreary enough experience these days without sitting miserably pressed into a seat for two or three hours. (Stiffly upright, of course, because only jerkfaces recline in coach.)\n\nBut Spirit changed that. No more paying for another full ticket (and good luck getting miles on it) or wrapping my arms around my rib cage for the entire flight when another seat isn't an option. Now we get the Big Front Seat. \n\nThe Big Front Seat is wider with more leg room and a big armrest between the two seats (instead of three) per row. I've definitely paid more to upgrade to identical (if newer-looking) seats on US Airways and American. (And on those occasions they laughingly called it \"first\" class.)\n\nThe first row has more leg room than the row behind it. I usually sit in seat 1A, but I'm thinking that for overnight flights I should try to book 1F on the other side so the light from the galley doesn't shine across the seat. (Just a tip.)\n\nWhat does the Big Front Seat cost? Sixty-five bucks each way when I fly LAS-DFW, which is the highest I've ever seen it. (I know LAS-PDX is only $13 more each way, and LAS-SAN was something similar.) Spirit fares can be cheaper if you buy them at the airport, so perhaps the upcharge for the BFS is cheaper there, too; I don't know. But on last night's very light flight (DFW-LAS), we had six empty BFS, and the flight attendant said they were available for purchase for $75, so I'll keep booking in advance, thanks. \n\nTo sum up: Money. Well. Spent. Spacious seat, better leg room (brilliant, even, in the first row), priority boarding, and just a far more pleasant experience. \n\nIf you're not on the plump side, the Big Front Seat may mean nothing to you. And if you rarely fly, the $9 club with its reduced baggage fees and sometimes reduced prices (at around $55\/year) may not do much for your wallet, although in my case it paid for itself by the second trip. (Oh, and contrary to what you may have heard, Spirit does allow you to bring a personal item for free: 16\"x14\"x12\" plus cameras, coats, etc.)\n\nBut for me, Spirit has been a revelation. Instead of charging three (or more) times as much for a bigger seat like other airlines do (and in the end, I suspect, filling the seats with upgraded passengers who don't make the airline much if any money - judging by how often I'm offered a last-minute upsell), Spirit sells those seats at a reasonable price, and I can personally attest to flying MUCH more because of this policy.\n\nOf course I miss the better days of flying, but for those of us in economy class, they're gone. Spirit may \"nickel and dime\" you to your final total cost, but they've always been friendly and courteous to me and the planes always leave on time, and I get to ride in comfort for (usually) about the same price as a squished seat on another carrier.  Just be smart about understanding the costs, and you could end up a fan like me.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":4,"date":"2012-05-01","useful":5,"counts":{"all":3,"coach":1,"four":1,"go":1,"row":5,"to":13,"friendly":1,"case":1,"sitting":1,"very":1,"every":1,"ticket":1,"entire":1,"try":1,"item":1,"carte":1,"round":1,"sixty-five":1,"tired":1,"second":1,"cost":2,"casual":1,"even":1,"what":2,"sum":1,"stars":2,"suspect":1,";":1,"ever":1,"full":2,"leg":3,"wrapping":1,"here":1,"understanding":1,"hours":1,"others":1,"passengers":1,"brilliant":1,"changed":1,"experience":2,"airport":1,"usually":2,"bob":1,"wedge":1,"total":1,"from":3,"revelation":1,"two":2,"6":1,"more":8,"``":3,"advance":1,"club":1,"me":6,"room":3,"this":2,"md-80":1,"ride":1,"getting":1,"wallet":1,"can":3,"plump":1,"my":4,"wearing":1,"give":1,"accept":1,"heard":1,"something":1,"keep":1,"!":1,"end":2,"sit":1,"travel":1,"comfort":1,"how":1,"amazing":1,"instead":2,"charging":1,"economy":1,"plans":1,"may":4,"plane":2,"a":18,"purchase":1,"light":2,"overnight":1,")":17,"so":4,"allow":1,"fan":1,"kindergarteners":1,"six":1,"over":1,"years":1,"course":2,"its":1,"la":1,"personal":1,",":47,"better":2,"spacious":1,"policy":1,"might":1,"happened":1,"then":1,"them":1,"good":1,"food":1,"dock":1,"bothering":1,"they":5,"not":4,"now":1,"cage":1,"complain":1,"bigger":1,"occasions":1,"filling":1,"reasonable":1,"each":3,"upsell":1,"x12":1,"x14":1,"side":2,"luck":1,"heavy":1,"everyone":1,"expect":1,"leave":1,"'":1,"miss":1,"since":1,"internet":1,"model":1,"squished":1,"free":1,"pleasant":1,"attendant":1,"aisle":1,"organic":1,"where":1,"could":2,"days":2,"times":1,"american":1,"first":3,"there":1,"veggie":1,"unaccompanied":1,"las-dfw":1,"tot":1,"another":3,"fees":1,"open":1,"55\/year":1,"airbus":1,"passes":1,"laughingly":1,"galley":1,"least":1,"1a":1,"too":1,"1f":1,"gowns":1,"legs":1,"final":1,"attendants":1,"eyes":1,"option":1,"that":6,"dreary":1,"forty-odd":1,"somewhat":1,"than":1,"boarding":1,"kind":1,"target":1,"16":1,"double":1,"coats":1,"contrary":1,"were":1,"priority":1,"and":22,"grotty":1,"buy":2,"have":2,"seen":2,"sells":1,"any":1,"baggage":1,"shorts":1,"-":1,"hearty":1,"which":1,"though":1,"price":2,"who":3,"paid":2,"75":1,"regular":1,"nothing":1,"why":1,"armrest":1,"especially":1,"sometimes":1,"definitely":1,"shop":1,"bring":1,"fear":1,"upgrade":1,"(":17,"enough":1,"should":1,"bfs":2,"flights":1,"?":3,"regularly":1,"do":7,"get":2,"13":1,"cheaper":2,"during":1,"silk":1,"miles":1,"dfw-las":1,"newer-looking":1,"courteous":1,"husband":1,"attest":1,"miserably":1,"fair":2,"frame":1,"seat":12,"are":2,"said":2,"behind":1,"between":1,"across":2,"available":1,"we":9,"las-san":1,"last":2,"always":3,"many":1,"etc":1,"faces":1,"whole":1,"upgraded":1,"flies":1,"wider":1,"grim-looking":1,"cameras":1,"three":3,"been":3,".":42,"much":4,"judging":1,"empty":1,"jerkfaces":1,"flight":5,"with":6,"offered":1,"gal":1,"personally":1,"prices":1,"spirit":10,"those":4,"paying":1,"look":1,"these":1,"tip":1,"n't":6,"pressed":1,"fun":1,"amenity":1,"almost":1,"is":10,"it":11,"itself":1,"embrace":1,"in":9,"bucks":1,"rib":1,"if":7,"perhaps":1,"make":1,"same":1,"read":1,"9":1,"dime":1,"recline":1,"on":10,"las-pdx":1,"i":18,"well":1,"spent":1,"burgers":1,"without":2,"the":40,"just":4,"money":2,"front":6,"thanks":1,"seats":5,"$":4,"thinking":1,"mcdonald":1,"had":2,"book":1,"4":1,"fares":1,"has":4,"smart":1,"identical":1,"around":2,"rules":1,"big":7,"*is*":1,"know":4,"kvetched":1,"like":3,"'ve":4,"night":1,"reduced":2,"because":3,"often":1,"some":1,"back":1,"upcharge":1,"ourselves":1,"rarely":1,"for":17,"per":1,"does":3,"booking":1,"be":2,"business":1,"airways":1,"although":1,"by":2,"shine":1,"comparison":1,"about":4,"oh":1,"of":14,"costs":1,"carrier":1,"plus":2,"airline":1,"mean":1,"or":4,"seeing":1,"into":3,"arms":1,"down":1,"pair":1,"your":3,"technically":1,"flying":4,"long":1,"class":2,"way":2,":":4,"was":3,"happy":1,"only":3,"but":10,"volume":1,"upright":1,"highest":1,"questionably":1,"he":1,"up":3,"us":2,"'re":3,"last-minute":1,"planes":1,"similar":1,"called":1,"gone":1,"red-eye":1,"an":2,"''":7,"fly":4,"as":6,"at":7,"chat":1,"nickel":1,"trip":1,"stiffly":1,"'ll":1,"no":1,"when":4,"other":3,"319s":1,"airlines":1,"you":13,"'s":5,"'m":3,"ago":1,"time":1,"far":1,"once":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":2}

I've always flown with either Delta or American Airlines and have never had a problem from point of purchase to the point of return, so I was expecting the same thing when I purchased my tickets on line for Spirit.\n\nI had to catch an 8am flight so I arrived at the airport at 7am. The first thing I noticed was that they had no designated kiosks to print off your boarding pass. I remembered from prior visits to that airport that they had general kiosks scattered around the place. I typed my information in and after it showed me all my flight details, when it came time to print,  received the message \"error, please see an agent for assistance. I tried again at that kiosk but got the same response as my result.\n\nI then had to wait in literally the longest line I could see to talk to a Spirit representative. I didn't make it to the front desk until 7:46..keep in mind I got there at 7am and my flight was at 8am. The lady told me I was too late, but she called upstairs and turns out they didn't even start boarding yet. That was cool for me in this case but overall, that's pretty unprofessional of the airline. I did end up making this flight because they didn't even start boarding until 8:30.\n\nI found out why they don't have kiosks though. They make you talk to the representative so they can charge you an extra $40 for your CARRY-ON! No other airline has ever made me pay for my carry-on. I was shocked when she hit me up for it. I ended up spending an extra $80 since I was going round trip on this airline. The only reason I took Spirit airline was because the tickets were cheap. Had I known that they were going to tag close to another $100 in hidden fees on, I would have just bought the more expensive ticket from a trusted airline. \n\nI will say that the flight itself was the most turbulent-less flight I've ever been on, but all the other chaos you have to deal with before even getting on the plane doesn't make up for the smooth ride.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2011-08-18","useful":0,"counts":{"all":2,"just":1,"scattered":1,"ended":1,"shocked":1,"yet":1,"before":1,"$":3,"point":2,"had":6,",":8,"late":1,"to":13,"charge":1,"going":2,"pretty":1,"hidden":1,"has":1,"details":1,"do":1,"return":1,"around":1,"cheap":1,"overall":1,"worst":1,"longest":1,"they":8,"desk":1,"front":1,"ticket":1,"lady":1,"cool":1,"tickets":2,"did":4,"turns":1,"kiosks":3,"'ve":2,"either":1,"always":1,"found":1,"response":1,"told":1,"round":1,"because":2,"upstairs":1,"deal":1,"see":2,"result":1,"pass":1,"close":1,"80":1,"out":2,"even":3,"n't":5,"error":1,"for":7,"literally":1,"assistance":1,"since":1,"please":1,"chaos":1,"case":1,"does":1,"typed":1,"print":2,"got":2,"ever":3,"bought":1,"remembered":1,"unprofessional":1,"never":1,"7:46..keep":1,"reason":1,"same":2,"100":1,"wait":1,"received":1,"carry-on":2,"getting":1,"of":3,"could":1,"prior":1,"airport":2,"flown":1,"expecting":1,"8am":2,"or":1,"first":1,"extra":2,"another":1,"fees":1,"message":1,"noticed":1,"your":2,"expensive":1,"from":3,"would":1,"spending":1,"there":1,"airlines":1,"been":1,".":19,"start":2,"again":1,"too":1,"was":9,"until":2,"more":1,"a":3,"``":1,"only":1,"flight":6,"that":8,"kiosk":1,"took":1,"but":4,"representative":2,"delta":1,"catch":1,"line":2,"general":1,"with":2,"spirit":3,"me":5,"boarding":3,"made":1,"showed":1,"this":3,"ride":1,"smooth":1,"up":4,"will":1,"tag":1,"can":1,"were":2,"making":1,"problem":1,"8:30":1,"my":6,"called":1,"and":4,"purchased":1,"then":1,"mind":1,"it":4,"agent":1,"an":4,"say":1,"itself":1,"at":5,"have":4,"in":5,"hit":1,"trip":1,"as":1,"she":2,"!":1,"information":1,"end":1,"thing":2,"pay":1,"make":3,"when":3,"american":1,"40":1,"other":2,"trusted":1,"place":1,"you":3,"airline":6,"'s":1,"tried":1,"though":1,"designated":1,"after":1,"visits":1,"most":1,"plane":1,"arrived":1,"on":5,"why":1,"known":1,"purchase":1,"7am":2,"off":1,"i":24,"no":2,"so":3,"came":1,"time":1,"the":20,"turbulent-less":1,"talk":2},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

(Our brother who was also traveling with us but booked seperately got a seat adjacent to us on both trips when we checked in at the same time.) My sister and I used a small 16in \"cheerleader\"  duffle bag as our free carry on (purchased off Amazon for $14) and it fit easily under the seat with 4 days worth of clothes stuffed inside.\n\nThe seats were tight no real leg room for a tall person. Im under 5'5 so i was ok my brother and sis on the other hand were crammed (5'6 and 5,11). The snacks and drinks on board were pricey but u could easily grab snacks prior to boarding and they dont count as ur personal item. There was also no Wi-Fi on board. Staff was nice and accommodating.\n\nThe flight out of Detroit was rough..lots of turbulence  but i believe it was due to the weather. The return flight was fine no issues smooth.

I flew from Vegas to Dallas round trip on the redeye and the plane was on time and they did not loose my bags.  Yes the seats are a little cramped, but I am 6ft and 205 and still was able to slide them under the seats in the front of me a bit for the two hour trip, my observation is 75% of the passengers are overweight, so what do you expect.  My trip back to Vegas was fine too..the plane was about 45 minutes delayed in leaving, but otherwise then that everything went fine.  Folks your flying no frills, A to B airline, read the website, follow the procedures and you should be fine.  Now I know they have planes that break down and are delayed etc... which they need to work on, but my personal trip was fine.

The only free bag you get is a personal item that will fit under the seat in front of you. \n\nBut the worst thing of it all was the flight into Vegas on the way home. The pilot announced that we were descending. Everything was going okay until suddenly it felt like THE PLANE JUST DROPPED OUT OF THE SKY. It was only a few seconds, but my heart felt like it just dropped to the floor. I thought the plane was crashing.

Saw more complaints than I wanted to,  so I did my homework.  Weight limit is 40 lbs, my bag I originally wanted to bring was oversized. Paid for my bags when I booked to save money.  Had ZERO problems checking in, printing boarding passes, or with employees.  One layover was delayed an hour,  but it was my final flight home so it didn't truly affect me personally.  I will say the worst part of my experience was other passengers.  You know the old saying you get what you pay for?  Spirit customers do not.  I heard complaint after complaint on things that should have been general knowledge if you look at the fare rules. I will say that leg room on one of the 3 flights\/layovers was horrendous. I'm 5' 9\" and I was beyond uncomfortable.  It's simple to use spirit...read all instructions and rules before booking, if you have a layover,  expect a delay. In other words, don't book a spirit flight with only an hour layover.  I noticed delays are almost guaranteed with the company.  Also,  flight attendants are only interested in customers who are willing to pay for water. It didn't bother me, but if you are accustomed to attention, go ahead and book southwest. Several flight attendants look a mess, and one male attendant was elderly and could barely make it down the aisle. Quick recap:\n\n*Pay for your checked and carryon bags when you book\n*Check fare rules, baggage limits when you book\n*Get to the airport early\n*If you make a large purchase after security, don't be dumb enough to think you don't have to pay for it.

Chuck then called me a liar saying no such previous call was ever made! I will NEVER in my life EVER consider flying with Spirit Airlines again! If this is how they treat their customers, saying they will give you a refund due to medical issues and then go back on their word then calling you a liar, no thank you!

had a fantastic experience flying from Las Vegas to San Diego! I was so nervous because I am a concierge and I print boarding passes all day long for people who say \"I will NEVER fly with them again!!!\" but came across a recent guest who raved about them, telling me that people who complain mostly either: A) don't pay attention OR B) they want to be pampered. After flying with them, I have to agree... although I am sure there are some grey areas here and there (i.e. if a flight is late, cxl'd or a plane is in bad shape).\n\nFirst off, I was taking my niece and nephew to Disneyland and like a dope..booked into the wrong airport! (I thought I was booking John Wayne...I don't know where my head was!) However, they treated us with the up-most respect as travelers with a 9 month old and and 7 year old. They allow you to check your stroller for free as well as your baby bag. We legitimately used our baby bag for baby items. They let you pre-board with children, and during the pre-boarding the pilot was SO nice that he let my nephew take a look at the cockpit and he was SO thrilled!! We took everything as \"personal items\" in backpacks (normal Jansport) or an arm bag and they all were perfectly fine, no issues with the bag size. We checked one bag (a duffle bag) and DEFINITELY book this ahead of time DURING your flight booking.This is when it is cheapest.\n\nEverything is straight forward, in my opinion. When you buy through their website, they constantly send you reminder emails to buy your bags ahead of time and to check your boarding passes in ahead of time. I think if you book third party (i.e. Expedia or something, that this is where the miscommunication comes in!) The plane was very nice on both legs of the flight, they looked pretty brand new. Maybe there are some older planes but I found no issues with being squished whatsoever!! I think some people are being overly dramatic here! The airline attendants were very nice and I even ordered some snacks. This is my BIGGEST peeve about PASSENGERS complaining about having to pay for drinks and food.... HEY PEOPLE, buy your damn snacks and drinks at the airport and carry them on the plane!! STOP WHINING!! Chances are, that you got your ticket for dirt cheap and now you're b***ching about paying $3 for a soda??! I bought a snack box for $6.50 and it contained wheat thins, cheese whiz, almonds, oreos and a mentos. I thought that was reasonable. \n\nHonestly, I paid $80 round trip for each person (3ppl & baby was free), we packed conservatively and only paid for one carry-on bag for $80 round trip (everything else in the backpacks  were \"personal items\"). So that was $420 for everyone including the 1 bag. My hotel stay cost more than the flight. Disneyland tickets cost me $860 for 4ppl. Why aren't more people complaining about Disneyland ripping you off?!? You cant beat the Spirit prices. \n\nMy only tips: don't be even more of a cheap-ass and expect free food on your flight. Buy it once inside of the airport and carry it on. Book your bags during your flight booking. Book DIRECTLY through the airline. DO NOT PAY FOR SEATING unless you're *desperately* afraid to be separated from your partner. I've been checking in boarding passes for this airline for the last 3 years- daily, and 98% of the time, all passengers will be grouped together. It is RARE that I've seen them book a couple in seats apart from each other. If you are an over-packer, someone who takes a months worth of clothes with you, needs to take all of their own products and 10 shoes with you..and thinks everything should be free even though your ticket is already dirt cheap... Spirit is NOT FOR YOU. You need to be pampered. Book Virgin or Delta. Spirit is very nice to people traveling with infants and kids!\n\n*Side note, only downside that I ever had on this flight is that some very \"interesting\" people may fly on this airline... I wont say it outright to stay PC but use your imagination. Low fares can possibly equal....","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":4,"date":"2015-12-19","useful":3,"counts":{"all":4,"month":1,"children":1,"issues":2,"send":1,"to":13,"whatsoever":1,"worth":1,"me":2,"very":4,"vegas":1,"telling":1,"ticket":2,"tickets":1,"having":1,"booking":2,"round":2,"clothes":1,"cost":2,"traveling":1,"drinks":2,"even":3,"n't":4,"new":1,"tips":1,"ever":1,"jansport":1,"here":2,"let":2,"duffle":1,"i.e":2,"box":1,"passengers":2,"kids":1,"ahead":3,"items":3,"experience":1,"airport":3,"products":1,"nervous":1,"opinion":1,"fantastic":1,"use":1,"from":3,"takes":1,"&":1,"more":3,"separated":1,"``":4,"expedia":1,"flying":2,"98":1,"baby":4,"carry-on":1,"fly":2,"cheapest":1,"this":6,"can":1,"my":7,"snacks":2,"concierge":1,"something":1,"want":1,"booking.this":1,"!":19,"needs":1,"complaining":2,"1":1,"may":1,"after":1,"wrong":1,"plane":3,"las":1,"a":16,"third":1,"maybe":1,"so":4,"allow":1,"shoes":1,"john":1,"*side":1,"through":2,"personal":2,"interesting":1,",":23,"late":1,"them":5,"someone":1,"food":2,"they":7,"party":1,"not":2,"now":1,"day":1,"wont":1,"reasonable":1,"each":2,"found":1,"everyone":1,"whiz":1,"expect":1,"year":1,"our":1,"80":2,"backpacks":2,"whining":1,"contained":1,"7":1,"print":1,"got":1,"dirt":2,"squished":1,"perfectly":1,"free":4,"cockpit":1,"disneyland":3,"thins":1,"peeve":1,"soda":1,"think":2,"first":1,"cheese":1,"already":1,"one":2,"downside":1,"directly":1,"carry":2,"ripping":1,"size":1,"passes":3,"checked":1,"guest":1,"together":1,"their":2,"legs":1,"attendants":1,"mostly":1,"that":9,"hotel":1,"took":1,"forward":1,"than":1,"boarding":3,"10":1,"b":1,"860":1,"grey":1,"i":22,"were":3,"treated":1,"and":24,"san":1,"say":2,"have":1,"need":1,"seen":1,"afraid":1,"note":1,"niece":1,"honestly":1,"sure":1,"unless":1,"normal":1,"thrilled":1,"3ppl":1,"who":4,"paid":2,"why":1,"looked":1,"definitely":1,"conservatively":1,"came":1,"oreos":1,"chances":1,"cheap":2,"nephew":2,"fine":1,"snack":1,"(":7,"should":1,"only":3,"wayne":1,"pretty":1,"do":4,"6.50":1,"beat":1,"stop":1,"during":3,"emails":1,"areas":1,"bag":8,"bad":1,"including":1,"where":2,"are":6,"arm":1,"packed":1,"3":2,"years-":1,"across":1,"bought":1,"we":4,"never":1,"attention":1,"however":1,"both":1,"last":1,"taking":1,"equal":1,"comes":1,"miscommunication":1,"respect":1,"cxl":1,"been":1,".":33,"pc":1,"damn":1,"website":1,"flight":7,"else":1,"dramatic":1,"cheap-ass":1,"prices":1,"spirit":3,"b***ching":1,"pilot":1,"paying":1,"look":1,"straight":1,"will":2,"up-most":1,"4ppl":1,"is":12,"it":6,"cant":1,"in":8,"partner":1,"if":3,"bags":2,")":9,"pay":3,"check":2,"9":1,"mentos":1,"reminder":1,"used":1,"diego":1,"recent":1,"off":2,"over-packer":1,"older":1,"pampered":2,"well":1,"thought":2,"person":1,"the":20,"being":2,"shape":1,"seats":1,"$":6,"legitimately":1,"had":2,"complain":1,"other":1,"raved":1,"fares":1,"take":2,"...":6,"checking":1,"couple":1,"possibly":1,"know":1,"apart":1,"outright":1,"like":1,"'ve":2,"either":1,"seating":1,"because":1,"old":2,"people":7,"some":5,"almonds":1,"thinks":1,"for":16,"though":1,"overly":1,"everything":4,"420":1,"?":4,"be":6,"wheat":1,"although":1,"on":6,"about":5,"rare":1,"of":9,"months":1,"airline":4,"or":5,"own":1,"pre-board":1,"travelers":1,"into":1,"your":13,"there":3,"hey":1,"long":1,"virgin":1,"low":1,"biggest":1,":":2,"was":10,"head":1,"buy":4,"constantly":1,"brand":1,"but":3,"delta":1,"with":10,"he":2,"inside":1,"us":1,"pre-boarding":1,"'re":2,"planes":1,"infants":1,"you..and":1,"agree":1,"ordered":1,"am":2,"an":2,"''":4,"imagination":1,"as":4,"at":2,"trip":2,"again":1,"%":1,"no":2,"when":2,"grouped":1,"book":6,"you":14,"nice":4,"dope..booked":1,"stay":2,"'d":1,"daily":1,"*desperately*":1,"time":4,"stroller":1,"once":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":3}

We purchased a package from Vegas.com and this was the airline used.  I had never heard of them, and now I know why.  I understand that they are all about low fares with no frills and I can appreciate cutting out some of the \"extra\" stuff, but then you have to do this well.  Our flight from Chicago to Vegas went off without a hitch and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised with our experience.  \n\nWhen we were leaving Vegas to head home, however, it was a completely different story.  We had already checked in for our flight via phone (checking in @ the airport costs extra) and were arriving at the airport when we were informed the flight had been cancelled.  As you can imagine we all were frustrated, but it was the complete lack of customer service that put me over the edge.  After waiting in line for nearly an hour, this was because numerous Spirit flights were cancelled, we had to tell THEM about other flight options when the earliest flight out of O'hare was Monday.  We had to tell them about Midway and thankfully we did.  We have a flight tomorrow using Southwest, thank goodness. \n\nThey did put us up in a nice hotel, but they hadn't called South Point to let them know we all were coming.  The rooms weren't even booked?!  Thankfully they had a nice room available. \n\nSpirit also provided taxi rides for us, but forgot to mention to us that it doesn't pay the driver-just the fare.  We had no more money on us and he couldn't take a tip via card. We felt terrible!  \n\nNeedless to say we will never never ever use Spirit again.

And I'm a pretty reasonable and paitent person.  \n\nTook this airline to Chicago last year because supposedly they were \"really affordable\".  Our plane emergency landed due to a crack in the windshield, which is a good reason for the detour I'll admit to that.  However it's what happen there after that really ticked me off!\n\n1)  Detour flight lands in Denver at about 5:30-6AM.  No word what so-ever as to when we'd be getting back aboard or going to another flight.  We each get a $7 voucher which only can be used at McDonalds due to the value, so imagine that line.\n\n2)  3 hours go by and finally someone says we have to all go down to the baggage claim area and grab our lagguages and then drag ourselves all the way back to the check-in desk.  Mind you, this is the entire plane (which was full) that has to do this.\n\n3)  First-come-first serve.  The entire plane then now has to stand in line with only 2 ticking agents to help us.  After 4 more hours of standing in line we get to the agent and the only options we have are to take connectiing flights to other cities (cities not even close to Chicago) or get booked on another airlines and WE HAVE TO PAY the difference.  In both cases we already lost 1 day in Denver, but now we'd lose another 1\/2 day as these flights were all the next morning.  \n\n4)  We take a flight that is from Spirit that takes off around 11:30PM...it's only 3PM.  We ask the woman if we could leave our bags behind the check in counter as it would be a hassle to drag (and fit) 8 suitcases around Denver until our flight.  The answer was \"NO.\"\n\n5)  Come back to catch this 11:30p flight and there's only the 8 of us and another passanger.  We board a damn hour late of course.  The plane takes off and lands within 15 minutes.  We are now told we cannot use this plane and we need to exit.  Turns out they put us on the same plane that had the broken windshield and they had only fixed it in the afternoon so the thing wasn't freaking even ready.  Smart move by the pilot who actually caught this error.  \n\n6)  No sleep and no shower, we are all p*ssed.  It took us another hour of arguing before we could get Spirit airlines to get us on another flight with another airlines and pay the difference themselves.  We also finally got them to paid for a hotel so we could actually take showers and sleep a few minutes.  They initially did not want to pay for a hotel.  Basically we get to the hotel at 4:30AM.  The flight is at 8:30AM.  Bullsh*t.  So now we get to spend our first day in Chicago sleeply as heck.\n\n7)  The flight back to Vegas was also delayed an hour.  Not to mention the kids in the back of us where acting like idiots screaming and yelling.  The flight attendants did do anything about it until one of them started to barf!  WTF?  This airlines is so gross...worst experience ever.  Period.  \n\n8)  Spirit gives us all a $50 travel voucher with them as an \"apology.\"  I told them to keep it.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2014-01-03","useful":4,"counts":{"all":5,"help":1,"move":1,"course":1,"lands":2,"sleep":2,"go":2,"mcdonalds":1,"windshield":2,"line":3,"before":1,"supposedly":1,"difference":2,"$":2,"fit":1,"(":3,"had":2,",":5,"denver":3,"actually":2,"late":1,"to":29,"finally":2,"going":1,"4":2,"pretty":1,"crack":1,"8":3,"has":2,"smart":1,"take":3,"then":2,"them":4,"good":1,"7":2,"emergency":1,"get":7,"ticked":1,"detour":2,"mention":1,"were":2,"worst":2,"3pm":1,"they":4,"desk":1,"not":4,"word":1,"now":4,"screaming":1,"day":3,"freaking":1,"entire":2,"sleeply":1,"like":1,"lost":1,"did":2,"turns":1,"50":1,"morning":1,"leave":1,"this":7,"someone":1,"check-in":1,"reasonable":1,"each":1,"so-ever":1,"11:30p":1,"grab":1,"fixed":1,"where":1,"8:30am":1,"person":1,"because":1,"says":1,"delayed":1,"due":2,"back":5,"full":1,"hassle":1,"voucher":2,"year":1,"our":5,"happen":1,"ourselves":1,"really":2,"even":2,"n't":1,"what":2,"for":3,"chicago":3,"arguing":1,"behind":1,"exit":1,"ticking":1,"got":1,"connectiing":1,"ever":2,"?":1,"told":2,"affordable":1,"be":3,"we":21,"4:30am":1,"do":2,"initially":1,"lose":1,"however":1,"hours":2,"broken":1,"reason":1,"if":1,"wtf":1,"imagine":1,"ask":1,"first-come-first":1,"cities":2,"come":1,"by":2,"after":2,"5:30-6am":1,"both":1,"about":2,"kids":1,"last":1,"yelling":1,"anything":1,"getting":1,"of":6,"could":3,"experience":1,"keep":1,"thing":1,"admit":1,"heck":1,"afternoon":1,"or":2,"'d":2,"first":1,"already":1,"airline":1,"within":1,"period":1,"one":1,"down":1,"put":1,"agents":1,"another":7,"p*ssed":1,".":35,"standing":1,"use":1,"from":1,"idiots":1,"would":1,"area":1,"caught":1,"there":2,"only":6,"next":1,"few":1,"2":2,"damn":1,"passanger":1,"way":1,"6":1,"lagguages":1,"themselves":1,"was":4,"until":2,"more":1,"attendants":1,"``":3,"flight":9,"1\/2":1,"on":3,"started":1,"hotel":3,"serve":1,"took":2,"but":1,"landed":1,"basically":1,"11:30pm":1,"catch":1,"cases":1,"stand":1,"with":3,"spirit":3,"pilot":1,"me":1,"15":1,"hour":3,"these":1,"board":1,"value":1,"shower":1,"suitcases":1,"can":2,"error":1,"gives":1,"minutes":2,"paitent":1,"are":3,"and":17,"claim":1,"flights":2,"have":3,"close":1,"...":2,"is":5,"barf":1,"mind":1,"it":7,"agent":1,"an":2,"''":3,"need":1,"as":5,"woman":1,"at":4,"showers":1,"in":10,"ready":1,"check":1,"around":2,"!":2,"bags":1,"'ll":1,"us":7,"want":1,"no":4,")":11,"pay":3,"travel":1,"that":7,"when":1,"same":1,"1":2,"also":2,"other":1,"5":1,"airlines":5,"which":3,"answer":1,"you":1,"out":1,"aboard":1,"used":1,"'s":3,"gross":1,"acting":1,"who":1,"paid":1,"3":2,"drag":2,"plane":6,"'m":1,"a":11,"booked":1,"bullsh*t.":1,"off":3,"takes":2,"apology":1,"i":3,"counter":1,"options":1,"baggage":1,"vegas":1,"so":5,"the":29,"spend":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

got off the absolute worst flight of my life from Denver to Las Vegas on Spirit Airline. The reason this flight was so terrible is two fold. Number one reason was the eight drunk, obnoxious, disrespectful, obscene people sitting in the row\/rows directly behind myself, my wife and my two daughters. We saw their antics in the airport, at the gate prior to boarding, drinking, yelling and basically causing a raucous and the Spirit gate personnel saw it too and were aware that they group was inebriated prior to boarding. No one from Spirit said a word to this group of obviously drink people and just allowed them to board the jet. We then sat on the flight line for over an hour waiting for the plane to be de-iced and had to listen to this group of people screaming and yelling and singing and carrying on. Talking about oral sex and anal sex and intercourse and every other manner of graphic language to make sure everyone within ear shot would know how they were gonna party it up in Vegas. All this while the flight attendants sat within earshot and did absolutely nothing to stop it. While preparing the cabin for take off my wife spoke to the cabin crew to make them aware of the volatile situation. The crew acknowledged the fact they knew the group was intoxicated and they said they weren't going to serve them any alcohol. The crew, including the Supervising flight attendant then proceed to sit idly by while my wife and I e have to engage in a verbal confrontation with four of the people to attempt to get them to stop their verbal barrage of offensive language and sexually charged conversation in addition to playing offensive, graphic music for all to hear, on their phones. This went on for over an hour while the plane was de-iced. They could've, at any time removed these people from the flight but did nothing! It wasn't until after take off, during drink service that the flight attendants made contact with these people, and decided the way they were going to deal with the situation was to deny them more alcohol. This party of people had brought their own alcohol on board anyway. There was no discussion about language or volume or bothering everyone around them. The crew didn't ask them to quite down until after ANOTHER passenger asked them to addressing the situation. And then even after that we had to listen to these people talk trash including name calling and over the top patronizing for the entire flight into Vegas. While exiting the plane I spoke to the senior flight attendant to express my disappointment with their lack of handling the situation, including their total lack of control of the aircraft and the fact that I made eye contact with her(attendant) several times while she sat behind her little window and witnessed the whole exchange between my family and the drunkards and did nothing. I asked her how could she sit by and allow my family to be subjected to this verbal abuse for over two hours and not take any action to protect the people on this flight from this obvious danger. Her response was to interrupt me several times and then tell me she was offended that I thought she wasn't doing her job. She then continued to try to run the whole situation around into me by saying I was I her personal space and I was becoming more of a problem then the drunk passengers! At that point I just left the aircraft in disgust. A absolute nightmare flight and total loss of control of the plane by the flight crew. The entire plane knew what was happening and the attendants did nothing but deny them alcohol. NEGLIGENT SERVICE AND LACK OF CONTROL AND ORDER BY SPIRIT!!! Spirit Airline allowed eight drunks  to run roughshod over them and endangered an entire, full flight of passengers and did nothing to stop it.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2015-04-17","useful":2,"counts":{"saying":1,"all":2,"shot":1,"inebriated":1,"just":3,"from":4,"over":5,"lack":3,"anyway":1,"four":1,"interrupt":1,"including":3,"earshot":1,"ear":1,"group":4,"how":2,"personal":1,"drunkards":1,"subjected":1,"point":1,"had":3,"waiting":1,"denver":1,"crew":5,"to":36,"window":1,"going":2,"board":2,"disgust":1,"playing":1,"then":6,"them":10,"around":2,"disrespectful":1,"sitting":1,"express":1,"stop":3,"negligent":1,"vegas":3,"worst":1,"know":1,"they":7,"gate":2,"not":1,"during":1,"drinking":1,"screaming":1,"entire":3,"several":2,"name":1,"did":6,"plane":5,"with":5,"make":2,"'ve":1,"try":1,"this":9,"row\/rows":1,"she":5,"anal":1,"the":44,"everyone":2,"directly":1,"verbal":3,"people":9,"absolutely":1,"phones":1,"sex":2,"fold":1,"decided":1,"sexually":1,"calling":1,"preparing":1,"were":4,"even":1,"what":1,"said":2,"alcohol":4,"for":7,"witnessed":1,"nightmare":1,"behind":2,"volatile":1,"between":1,"it":5,"got":1,"get":1,"drink":2,"be":2,"we":3,"full":1,"run":2,"exchange":1,"de-iced":2,"prior":2,"antics":1,"bothering":1,"quite":1,"hours":1,"reason":2,"confrontation":1,"ask":1,"supervising":1,"attendant":3,"went":1,"after":3,"spoke":2,"passengers":2,"about":2,"engage":1,"yelling":2,"language":3,"of":16,"could":2,"graphic":2,"terrible":1,"times":2,"intoxicated":1,"airport":1,"barrage":1,"airline":2,"(":1,"action":1,"whole":2,"asked":2,"and":33,"own":1,"sat":3,"family":2,"danger":1,"into":2,"within":2,"number":1,"obscene":1,"one":2,"down":1,"na":1,"jet":1,"another":1,"total":2,"singing":1,"causing":1,"little":1,"eye":1,"proceed":1,"service":2,"addition":1,"top":1,"there":1,"two":3,"by":5,"their":6,"her":6,"music":1,"too":1,"way":1,"handling":1,"was":14,"until":2,"cabin":2,"listen":2,"attendants":3,"gon":1,"flight":13,"roughshod":1,"on":7,"aircraft":2,"becoming":1,"deal":1,"serve":1,"protect":1,"but":2,"aware":2,"volume":1,"carrying":1,"hear":1,"basically":1,"loss":1,"e":1,"line":1,"removed":1,"patronizing":1,"spirit":5,"me":3,"boarding":2,"myself":1,"made":2,"word":1,"sit":2,"hour":2,"these":3,"up":1,"idly":1,"tell":1,"n't":4,"offended":1,"while":6,"obvious":1,".":24,"situation":5,"problem":1,"more":2,"my":8,"at":3,"control":3,"passenger":1,"addressing":1,"would":1,"is":1,"allowed":2,"life":1,"an":3,"continued":1,"talking":1,"manner":1,"have":1,"in":6,"exiting":1,"saw":2,"any":3,"absolute":2,"!":5,"obnoxious":1,"drunk":2,"conversation":1,")":1,"personnel":1,"discussion":1,"that":6,"offensive":2,"off":3,",":15,"contact":2,"endangered":1,"other":1,"take":3,"obviously":1,"party":2,"trash":1,"daughters":1,"disappointment":1,"sure":1,"job":1,"knew":2,"space":1,"raucous":1,"abuse":1,"eight":2,"nothing":5,"intercourse":1,"response":1,"las":1,"a":5,"deny":2,"attempt":1,"happening":1,"wife":3,"i":9,"no":2,"acknowledged":1,"brought":1,"or":2,"thought":1,"doing":1,"drunks":1,"so":1,"fact":2,"allow":1,"time":1,"every":1,"senior":1,"charged":1,"oral":1,"order":1,"talk":1,"left":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

Lauderdale and had no problems, issues, or delays. This time, we flew to Vegas from O'hare Wed-Sat and it was a completely different situation. I knew about the luggage cost, so the additional $150 I had to pay for my boyfriend and I was something I was \"okay\" with. I paid on-line the night before because it's a bit cheaper that way. For carry-on, I paid $40 each way for his bag, and for my check-in luggage, I paid $35 each way. \n\nWe arrived to O'hare on Wednesday 2\/13, with clear, blue skies in Chicago and obviously in Vegas, however, there was a two hour delay. So instead of leaving at 9:09 am, we ended up departing at 10:51 am. When we asked the extremely rude lady at the counter for the reason, all we got in response was an idiotic look and a \"whhaaaaatttt?\" At this point, my boyfriend was going crazy, but I was still \"okay\" with the situation because I've heard A LOT worse, and read A LOT worse. \n\nFast forward three days later... we arrive to the Vegas airport about 1.5 hours before our scheduled departure at 5:20 pm. We go through check-in and all that, get to our gate, and it says 5:54 pm. Ok.. fine... we can handle 30 minutes. I step out to get a drink, and my boyfriend calls me to tell me that it just got pushed to 8pm!!!!!!!!!!!! I get back to the gate, and they announce that the plane has a maintenance issue and is currently in San Diego. Not sure how much more time passes by, but we get another announcement that the plane is now delayed until 9:30 pm and that there is something wrong with the plane and is getting a part replaced in San Diego. WOW... \n\nAt this point, they called everyone up to receive a voucher. I got in line thinking it may be a voucher for a free flight or something (HA!), though my boyfriend was against getting anything from them, and we ended up getting a voucher for a meal in the airport for $7 per person... are you freaking kidding me?! We ended up using it and it was not even enough to cover two pretzels and two drinks... thanks a lot Spirit!!! It's more like a joke than anything... \n\nAt one point in our short stay at the airport, I walked by the screen, and saw that the departure now says 10:04 pm... these bastards didn't even announce anything until 15 minutes after I saw the time on the screen. There was nothing anyone could do but wait... and that's what we all did. \n\nNEVER AGAIN am I going to fly through Spirit... I don't know how the hell this company is still in business or operating.

Customers finally realized we were in the wrong line, only to be moved to an equally long line with poor service.  POOR STAFFING - For the record, I was at the airport nearly 2 hours before my scheduled flight. \n\nI was put on a standby flight that I clearly wasn't going to get on; however, they still ticketed me for this flight while REFUSING to tell me my other options.  When I finally was able to get the other option (ie, my original flight had a connection that I was likely going to miss due to a delay out of Las Vegas), the employee told me the wrong time.  I was under the impression the flight would be leaving its connection city at 1:30pm.  The actual time was closer to 7pm.\n    \nSix passengers on the flight from Las Vegas to DFW were hoping to make a connection to Chicago in DFW.  Our plane (which was parked at the same gate) left 5 minutes prior to our arrival.  There was no coordination of efforts.\n   \nBecause of this, 6 of us were stranded in DFW for 12 hours with no hotel option.  We were (begrudgingly) given food vouchers.  The supervisor, Carlos Betancourt, was the absolute worst customer service employee I've ever come across.  I hope you strongly consider a re-training of your employees on customer-centric policies and politeness.  As a student of business marketing, I was embarrassed that this sort of behavior is allowed in the airline industry.\n    \nCarlos B refused to give me his supervisor's name.  I was provided with your 1-800 number - cut off 3 times (it wasn't my phone) just when I was making progress.  The lack of synergy between your corporate and field operations is beyond terrible.\n   \nI will say, Larissa in DFW (a Spirit staff) was delightful - super nice and understanding.  She deserves a raise!  Perhaps, she could teach the course on customer engagement. \n\nI personally regret purchasing a ticket from Spirit Airlines - first and last.  In the end, I feel like you guys should refund my ticket (and the 5 other passengers), but I realize that's never going to happen.  Please try harder - in this economic state, you can't just expect to provide sub-par performance and survive.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2012-05-30","useful":0,"counts":{"operations":1,"impression":1,"all":1,"six":1,"consider":1,"just":2,"-":6,"lack":1,"course":1,"parked":1,"still":1,"its":1,"before":1,"cut":1,"(":6,"had":1,",":14,"should":1,"to":16,"finally":2,"1:30pm":1,"under":1,"employee":2,"staffing":1,"scheduled":1,"me":4,"customers":1,"his":1,"get":2,"food":1,"vouchers":1,"vegas":3,"worst":1,"nearly":1,"they":1,"gate":1,"2":1,"ticket":2,"realize":1,"like":1,"name":1,"'ve":1,"try":1,"delightful":1,"she":2,"betancourt":1,"carlos":2,"because":1,"regret":1,"staff":1,"synergy":1,"likely":1,"economic":1,"expect":1,"our":3,"happen":1,"beyond":1,"out":1,"closer":1,"n't":3,"for":3,"chicago":1,"please":1,"coordination":1,"wrong":2,"when":2,"waiting":1,"re-training":1,"between":1,"progress":1,";":1,"customer-centric":1,"ever":1,"across":1,"told":1,"arrival":1,"be":2,"we":3,"policies":1,"business":1,"state":1,"marketing":1,"never":1,"however":1,"refused":1,"hours":2,"same":1,"put":1,"teach":1,"understanding":1,"come":1,"passengers":2,"actual":1,"service":2,"ticketed":1,"standby":1,"of":8,"could":1,"terrible":1,"experience":1,"leaving":1,"prior":1,"connection":3,"airline":1,"efforts":1,"options":1,"first":1,"strongly":1,"equally":1,"there":1,"feel":1,"ca":1,"number":1,"airlines":2,"embarrassed":1,"atrocious":1,"miss":1,"your":3,"city":1,"given":2,"from":2,"raise":1,"would":1,"super":1,"dfw":4,"engagement":1,"due":1,"long":2,".":24,"going":3,"6":1,"politeness":1,"survive":1,"was":16,"tell":1,"sort":1,"direction":1,"only":1,"flight":6,"option":2,"on":5,"hotel":1,"but":1,"phone":1,"refund":1,"personally":1,"last":1,"line":3,"with":4,"spirit":3,"customer":2,"b":1,"this":4,"begrudgingly":1,"harder":1,"refusing":1,"us":1,"will":1,"record":1,"while":2,"hope":1,"behavior":1,"were":5,"making":1,"my":6,"employees":1,"and":6,"stranded":1,"supervisor":2,"hoping":1,"give":1,"minutes":1,"is":2,"in":8,"moved":1,"it":2,"an":2,"sub-par":1,"7pm":1,"say":1,"at":4,"allowed":1,"times":1,"ie":1,"check":1,"as":1,"absolute":1,"!":1,"bags":1,"perhaps":1,"end":1,"deserves":1,"provide":1,"make":1,"that":4,"able":1,"airport":2,"purchasing":1,"clearly":1,"delay":1,"field":1,"other":3,"5":2,"which":1,"performance":1,"you":3,"incredibly":1,"nice":1,"poor":2,"'s":2,"provided":1,"3":1,"1-800":1,"plane":1,"student":1,"guys":1,"larissa":1,"las":3,"a":9,"realized":1,"off":1,"i":15,"industry":1,"no":3,"original":1,")":6,"time":2,"the":18,"12":1,"corporate":1,"began":1,"left":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

I would not even accept a free flight on one of their planes. (Even with a free flight, you still might have to pay their check in bags fee, their fee to carry on bags, their fee to pick a seat, their fee for a soda, their fee because your bag is over 40 pounds, their fee because you didn't pay the fee earlier, their fee for joining the nine dollar fare club)  From now on, I will pay the extra $200 fee and fly United.\n\nMy Spirit flight from Las Vegas to Chicago landed 11 hours late because Spirit did not have enough ground crew to load the check  in bags onto the plane in Las Vegas, so the flight left an hour late.  I missed my connection in Dallas, and had to be rerouted through South Carolina.  \n\nI had things to do in Chicago, including Book of Moron tickets and I missed that play because of Spirit.  The \"manager\" in Dallas - a bald headed guy in his forties made me feel like it was my fault the plane was late.  He showed no empathy, and his attitude was like \"this is what you get when you fly ultra low cost carriers\".  I thought he was a total prick, but then again he has a shitty job, working for a shitty airline.  In fact, most of the spirit staff I interacted with had that approach.\n\nOn the return flight from Chicago to Las Vegas Spirit again did not have enough ground crew to unload check in bags off the plane, so I never even got our check in bags.  The bags arrived at my house three days later in a delivery shipment.\n\nThe reason Spirit can't get anything right in Las Vegas is that they have basically a rush of  planes from all over the U.S. land at the same late night time (starting around 11:00 pm), and then they are supposed to turn around all the planes and have them leave between 30 and 45 minutes later.  They don't have enough ground staff to handle the number of planes coming and going, so like a freeway at rush hour... it all turns into gridlock.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-07-30","useful":1,"counts":{"things":1,"all":3,"less":1,"-":2,"over":2,"dollar":1,"focus":1,"manager":1,"through":1,"40":1,"still":1,"staff":2,"$":1,"(":2,"extra":1,"had":3,",":19,"crew":2,"late":4,"to":12,"going":1,"has":1,"might":1,"ca":1,"carolina":1,"then":2,"customers":1,"his":2,"return":1,"around":2,"get":2,"possible":1,"shitty":2,"vegas":4,"gridlock":1,"they":4,"not":4,"now":1,"tickets":1,"like":3,"pounds":1,"did":3,"turns":1,"attitude":1,"leave":1,"bag":1,"dallas":2,"night":1,"including":1,"guy":1,"11:00":1,"because":4,"hour":2,"joining":1,"house":1,"seat":1,"cost":1,"are":1,"year":1,"our":1,"even":3,"will":2,"what":1,"missed":2,"for":3,"chicago":3,"enough":3,"does":1,"shipment":1,"between":1,"got":1,";":1,"ground":3,"approach":1,"be":1,"earlier":1,"business":1,"u.s.":1,"never":2,"free":2,"hours":1,"job":1,"no":1,"on":5,"empathy":1,"would":2,"anything":1,"getting":1,"fault":1,"30":1,"reason":1,"turn":1,"connection":1,"airline":1,"soda":1,"onto":1,"south":1,"load":1,"headed":1,"feel":1,"into":1,"number":1,"one":2,"right":1,"planes":4,"rerouted":1,"carry":1,"total":1,"your":1,"once":1,"fee":9,"from":4,"working":1,"interacted":1,"give":1,"three":1,".":15,"their":9,"low":1,"was":4,"pm":1,"``":3,"flight":5,"that":3,"club":1,"spirit":7,"but":1,"it":2,"delivery":1,"landed":1,"basically":1,"...":1,"an":1,"with":2,"than":1,"he":3,"me":1,"pull":1,"rush":2,"made":1,"showed":1,"this":1,"fliers":1,"n't":4,"nine":1,"supposed":1,"of":6,"ultra":1,"my":4,"pick":1,"and":8,"have":6,"do":3,"minutes":1,"is":3,"them":1,"accept":1,"days":1,"''":3,"fly":3,"at":3,"want":1,"in":13,"handle":1,"check":4,"worry":1,"if":1,"bags":6,"united":1,"carriers":1,")":2,"pay":3,"45":1,"when":1,"same":1,"book":1,"moron":1,"you":4,"fare":1,"200":1,"play":1,"repeat":1,"prick":1,"again":3,"bald":1,"most":1,"plane":3,"arrived":1,"coming":1,"the":18,"las":4,"a":12,"thought":1,"land":1,"off":1,"unload":1,"i":11,"later":2,"freeway":1,"forties":1,"so":3,"time":1,"11":1,"model":1,"left":1,"starting":1,"fact":1,"know":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

have flown Spirit for years as a cheap way to go roundtrip to florida from chicago.\n I have lost 25,000 miles under their rule that unless you fly within 6 months you lose your miles.  well I don't fly them in the Summer and they don't even have flights other then one that takes over 12 hours.  I'm not going to fly to another place because I'd lose my miles.  Next:  I got a Master Card because they give 15,000 miles enough for 3 round trips.  Are you KIDDING?  The 2500 mile flights are extremely few.  Maybe one a month so they can say they offer the 'fare'.  the rest of the time it is 25,000 miles EACH WAY.  Would you believe that Los Angeles to Las Vegas was 50,000 miles?\nThe cash fare was $18 round trip .  If someone isn't thinking they tell their assistant to \"book me using miles\".  That's what Spirit does.  They have figured more ways to screw the passenger:\n\n1.  A great one that made Spirit $10s of millions.  A little rule that other airlines do NOT use.  Spirit made a small change and said that a checked bag cannot weigh more than 40 pounds.  40 !   YES 40!.  All airlines in the world say 50.  Ok if your bag weighs 10 pounds Spirit has just had you drop by 25% the clothes you can pack.  40 pounds to 30 pounds.  Now if the bag weighs over 40 -- say 41  yes I mean 1 pound over there is a penalty.  The people next to me paid $90 for bags that weighed less than 50 but more than 40.  that's all profit to Spirit.  And it is also ready:  NON REVENUE INCOME.  It is not from the 'fares' they charge.  Look at their financial statements and see that their non revenue is in the $100s of millions.  YES from baggage, seats, cancelation, late fees, food and beverage, and other bits and pieces they have made almost as much in non revenue as revenue.\n\n2.  Why do you think they have fares for $9 or $19 or $29.  The government gets its taxes on that fare.  then $25 for the seat; $50 for the bag; water etc.  Now they make $80 each way in 'non revenue' that the government does not charge the same taxes.\n\nThey found a great loophole and maximize it.  I'd like to say my fee was $10 and be taxed at 20% for $2 and make another $80 that was taxed at 6%.  HMMMM.\n\n3.  The Master Card:  miss one payment on any of your OTHER cards and Spirit card gets huge increases in interest and late fees.  More than any other.\n\n4.  The $9 fare club used to be $29 a year.  Now it is $59 and NON refundable.  You must cancel way before it will be charged automatically to your credit card.  \n\n5.  Credit card is free first year.  They promote as you know at the gate and ON THE PLANE.  Please sign up for the free Master Card and get 15,000 miles enough for 3 round trips.  FALSE ADVERTISING.  but if the flight attendants don't offer the card they can be FIRED.\n\n6.  The card used to get you in line to check in separately and avoid the wait at check in.  NOT ANYMORE.  Just wait.  No benefits here.\n\n7. A few days ago we flew Orlando to Ohare.  Pilot announced good news bad news.  Good was that we landed 10 minutes early.  Bad news is that we had to wait 30 minutes for an open gate.  weather was fine and sunny.  Well 2 hours and 40 minutes later we deplaned.  yes -- had they waited 3 hours they would have been fined $27,500 per passenger for 3 hour delays.\n\nOh over 2 hours on TARMAC they have to supply you with water and food.  We got an 8 oz bottle of warm water and -- ready -- a tiny cracker!  NOT KIDDING.  That's their food and water.  \n\n8.  bottle of water on plane is $3.  Before you get on it is $2 at airport.\n\n9.  Carry on that is stored above your head costs more than checked.  And checked may take 30 minutes to unload.  so people pay more to carry and Spirit makes more because they are inefficient.\n\n10.   They stole refunds of $400 from me.  I canceled a flight 3 months in advance and was told I had a credit of $600 minus $200 for cancel.  Ok at least I'd get $400 back.  So I flew on another airliine since my plans had changed.  About a month after my original Spirit flight I went to book a new flight on Spirit and gave them the flight confirm code for my credit.  ARE YOU READY.\n\n\"Sir you didn't show up for the flight so you lost the entire $600\".  Are you kidding?  Of course I didn't show up I had canceled.  \"Sir we have no record of that cancelation\"  You didn't show up,.  Well I figured this 'trick \" out too.\n\nSpirit used to give a VOUCHER number for a 1 year credit.  They would know you used it or not.  they changed the voucher to using your original flight code.\nso if you cancel and book before the code\/flight would have taken off you're ok and can use it.  But forget the one year.  If you go to use the credit after the flight would have taken off, Spirit just says  \"YOU DIDN\"T SHOW UP\".  How can you disprove that?  Of course you didn't.\n\nYes I spoke to someone in INDIA or PHILLIPINES.\n\nI should have asked for an employee name (they lie) and a number or record it to prove.  Even my secretary was on the phone when it was canceled so both o","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-09-20","useful":4,"counts":{"all":2,"code":2,"forget":1,"month":2,"mile":1,"'fares":1,"go":2,"15,000":2,"to":26,"charge":2,"under":1,"fly":3,"'non":1,"vegas":1,"entire":1,"--":4,"this":1,"small":1,"round":3,"clothes":1,"says":1,"sign":1,"voucher":2,"10s":1,"even":2,"n't":8,"what":1,"chicago":1,"tarmac":1,"above":1,"new":1,";":2,"told":1,"here":1,"hours":4,"change":1,"wait":3,"great":2,"30":3,"credit":6,"airport":1,"advertising":1,"makes":1,"use":3,"fee":1,"from":4,"spoke":1,"would":5,"prove":1,"next":2,"few":2,"6":3,"taken":2,"tell":1,"more":7,"``":5,"club":1,"it":11,"phone":1,"landed":1,"warm":1,"90":1,"must":1,"me":3,"hour":1,"ohare":1,"can":6,"my":6,"give":2,"india":1,"pieces":1,"stole":1,"!":3,"huge":1,"1":3,"how":1,"gate":2,"code\/flight":1,"fare":3,"plans":1,"sir":2,"may":1,"after":2,"plane":2,"las":1,"a":19,"roundtrip":1,"maybe":1,"baggage":1,"so":6,"over":4,"years":1,"course":2,"its":1,"before":3,"25":2,"20":1,"40.":1,"50,000":1,"late":2,"400":2,"loophole":1,"then":2,"them":2,"someone":2,"food":3,"flew":2,"they":21,"not":8,"now":3,"name":1,"didn":1,"did":4,"weather":1,"each":2,"found":1,"went":1,"mean":1,"weighs":2,"8.":1,"fired":1,"'fare":1,"year":4,"80":2,"out":1,"'":3,"profit":1,"miss":1,"since":1,"7":1,"got":2,"100s":1,"announced":1,"free":2,"card":8,"advance":1,"benefits":1,"florida":1,"days":1,"place":1,"think":1,"waited":1,"first":1,"revenue":5,"number":2,"one":5,"another":3,"fees":2,"carry":2,"open":1,"millions":2,"little":1,"checked":3,"least":1,"their":5,"2":5,"master":3,"too":1,"bits":1,"attendants":1,"inefficient":1,"that":19,"believe":1,"than":5,"10":4,"12":1,"19":1,"18":1,"cards":1,"minus":1,"and":28,"false":1,"'trick":1,"say":4,"have":12,"any":2,"screw":1,"also":1,"take":1,"200":1,"unless":1,"paid":1,"extremely":1,"payment":1,"refunds":1,"later":1,"weigh":1,"show":4,"cheap":1,"fine":1,"phillipines":1,"(":1,"delays":1,"3":7,"should":1,"penalty":1,"flights":2,"going":1,"employee":1,"8":1,"do":5,"get":4,"assistant":1,"sunny":1,"25,000":2,"taxes":2,"bag":4,"bad":2,"miles":8,"taxed":2,"secretary":1,"seat":1,"see":1,"are":5,"said":1,"ways":1,"please":1,"enough":2,"disprove":1,"we":6,"news":3,"both":1,"figured":2,"etc":1,"fined":1,"asked":1,"supply":1,"29":2,"maximize":1,"cancel":3,"airlines":2,"tiny":1,".":87,"much":1,"interest":1,"flight":8,"spirit":12,"pilot":1,"look":1,"cracker":1,"cash":1,"will":1,"hmmmm":1,"pack":1,"pound":1,"almost":1,"is":12,"non":4,"weighed":1,"canceled":3,"good":2,"in":11,"ready":3,"if":6,"bags":1,"anymore":1,")":1,"pay":1,"make":2,"same":1,"trip":1,"9":3,"gets":2,"used":4,"lie":1,"flown":1,"off":2,"i":18,"well":3,"costs":1,"bottle":2,"the":36,"charged":1,"summer":1,"just":3,"less":1,"when":1,"rest":1,"stored":1,"seats":1,"yes":5,"$":24,"thinking":1,"had":6,"book":3,"4":1,"fares":1,"has":1,"gave":1,"government":2,"early":1,"increases":1,"know":2,"using":2,"59":1,"like":1,"lost":2,"pounds":4,"orlando":1,"50":3,"separately":1,"5.":1,"t":1,"lose":2,"drop":1,"people":2,"back":1,"27,500":1,"for":16,"confirm":1,"avoid":1,"per":1,"does":2,"refundable":1,"?":4,"be":4,"by":1,"takes":1,"on":10,"about":1,"ok":3,"world":1,"oh":1,"of":11,"months":2,"o":1,"angeles":1,"cancelation":2,"oz":1,"or":5,"automatically":1,"deplaned":1,"statements":1,"within":1,"because":3,"been":1,"financial":1,"your":6,"there":1,"kidding":3,"los":1,"way":4,":":4,"was":9,"head":1,"offer":2,"but":3,"airliine":1,"line":1,"promote":1,"with":1,",":7,"made":3,"up":5,"record":2,"'re":1,"minutes":4,"trips":2,"passenger":2,"600":2,"an":3,"''":5,"as":4,"at":7,"check":2,"%":3,"no":2,"water":5,"40":6,"41":1,"other":5,"income":1,"you":24,"2500":1,"'s":3,"why":1,"'d":3,"'m":1,"ago":1,"unload":1,"changed":2,"rule":2,"beverage":1,"time":1,"original":2},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

I thought how cool this would be so I can visit my friends and family back in San Diego more often . I joined the club then when I start booking my flight there were are all of these hidden fees. \n\nThere is a $40.00 each way baggage fee. If your luggage goes over 40 pounds they will charge you another $40.00. Since they didn't want to give me a refund on my membership fee I decided next time I will not bring any luggage. I just stored some clothes in San Diego so I wouldn't have to pay this ridiculous fee. You can bring a small carry on like a back pack or a purse. \n\nYou have to pay for your seat. Just because you bought the ticket doesn't mean you have a seat. This fee applies both ways. I think I paid $10.00 each way. \n\nThere is also a reservation fee. I forgot how much that was. \n\nDon't come on the plane hungry or thirsty because you have to pay for everything! We bought two canned drinks for $5.00 or you would pay $3.50 for one. I didn't even have a chance to drink all my cranberry juice because as soon as I started drinking we were getting ready to land so we had to throw away our trash. If you are going on a short trip don't bother getting any drinks just wait until you land. \n\nThis airline doesn't allow you to be even four minutes late so be on time or you will have to purchase a new ticket like my cousin. They stick to a strict schedule . \n\nEven though the boarding pass said when they would be loading I checked with one of their customer service agents too. She talked to us like we were slow.

Why am i going to pay 30 to 50 dollars extra for stuff I don't need.  \n\nYes the seats are more tight than the back seats of a mini sportscar but for a 1 to 3 hour trip its doable.

Late departure for no assorted made up reasons (once it was a late flight crew, the other time they said ti was due to weather....seriously? the plane we were waiting on was coming from Portland to Las Vegas and there were no storms. I think they just say this because they are short planes and they dont mind passing the wait time on to passengers.

While it is true that Spirit charges you for literally EVERYTHING, including check in baggages, carry on baggages, water, food, alcohol, and even SEAT selection. But it's like you're \"getting what you paid for.\" HOWEVER, I must point out that even with all these extra charges, occasionally Spirit is STILL cheaper than the cheapest flight on expedia, or Southwest. \n\nThe staff is easy to work with and they give you a heads up that if you wanted to be seated together, you must immediately go to the Spirit agent at the door and let them know. I had no problem getting seats sitting together for four people both ways. The staff on the plane aren't gorgeous like other flight attendants, but they are kind and at your service. They don't really pay attention to the patrons during the whole flight, but that's what the service button is for. \n\nPlane was dirty both ways and seats in the back and small and uncomfortable (I'm 5'3in and my knees hurt). The front seats are bigger and have head rests. I went to Vegas, so the ride was fast (1.5) and we had no problem with any delays.\n\nTips: \n1) Paying online for check-in and carry-ons bags are cheaper than paying at the airport. \n2) EVERYTHING is charged. DO NOT assume anything is complimentary.\n3) ONLY fly with Spirit if it is a SHORT flight. Short flights allows you to take a nice nap and wake up at your destination with maybe a bathroom break (that IS free). In the long run, short flights will be cheaper (all things included - comfortably, price..etc).  Long flights may cause you to want to buy the horrendously priced food\/drinks and cause body aches. \n\nOverall: worth it if you can travel light and plan to go somewhere nearby, or bring your own food onto the plane. Other airlines are obviously better, but this is definitely cheap.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":2,"date":"2014-01-02","useful":4,"counts":{"all":2,"selection":1,"true":1,"cheap":1,"four":1,"not":1,"including":1,"seats":3,"go":2,"still":1,"comfortably":1,"food\/drinks":1,"staff":2,"charges":2,"somewhere":1,"(":4,"delays":1,"point":1,"had":2,",":18,"than":2,"better":1,"to":9,"only":1,"occasionally":1,"easy":1,"worth":1,"southwest":1,"do":2,"them":1,"5'3in":1,"sitting":1,"food":2,"overall":1,"cheaper":3,"break":1,"vegas":1,"know":1,"they":3,"front":1,"during":1,"bigger":1,"reading":1,"like":2,"immediately":1,"bring":1,"button":1,"disregarding":1,"these":1,"check-in":1,"small":1,"went":1,"carry-ons":1,"people":1,"doing":1,"back":1,"seat":1,"are":5,"uncomfortable":1,"out":1,"even":2,"will":1,"what":2,"alcohol":1,"for":5,"ways":2,"literally":1,"research":1,"everything":2,"3":1,"it":4,"tips":1,"before":1,"cause":2,"dirty":1,"body":1,"be":2,"we":1,"run":1,"attention":1,"however":1,"free":1,"water":1,"let":1,"wanted":1,"both":2,"anything":1,"getting":2,"rests":1,"allows":1,"airport":1,"'d":1,"patrons":1,"complimentary":1,"onto":1,"or":2,"first":1,"own":2,"extra":1,"included":1,"fast":1,"carry":1,"baggages":2,"your":4,"bathroom":1,"heads":1,"i":5,"service":2,"destination":1,"airlines":1,"long":2,".":20,"2":1,"recommend":1,":":2,"was":2,"attendants":1,"head":1,"buy":1,"horrendously":1,"on":3,"gorgeous":1,"but":4,"hurt":1,"wake":1,"with":5,"spirit":5,"must":2,"paying":2,"kind":1,"cheapest":1,"this":1,"ride":1,"work":1,"up":2,"seated":1,"n't":2,"reviews":1,"while":1,"'re":2,"can":1,"light":1,"problem":2,"my":1,"and":14,"1.5":1,"flights":3,"have":1,"give":1,"knees":1,"is":9,"``":1,"agent":1,"''":1,"fly":1,"expedia":1,"at":4,"want":1,"in":3,"door":1,"check":1,"if":4,"aches":1,"maybe":1,"no":2,"flight":4,"pay":1,"travel":1,"that":5,"-":1,"any":1,"1":1,"nap":1,"other":2,"take":1,"online":1,"you":10,"really":1,"nice":1,"'s":2,"bags":1,"may":1,"paid":1,"plane":3,"plan":1,"previous":1,"'m":1,"priced":1,"price..etc":1,"a":4,"short":3,"assume":1,"whole":1,"together":2,"obviously":1,")":7,"definitely":1,"so":1,"things":1,"the":16,"nearby":1,"charged":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":2}

We bought the tickets from Vegas to Ft. Lauderdale for a connection to our port for our cruise vacation.  It all started out with additional charges for our luggage, then the overweight charges.  We got past that and got to our gate to notice that our flight was delayed 4 hours.  Would not have been a huge problem, but we were on the red eye flight.  A huge thanks to the volunteers at the McCarran USO.  So, the flight takes offer and we are asked if we would like to purchase $3 soda or a $7 pillow and blanket combo.  We get to FL, go on our cruise with Royal Caribbean, which was outstanding and warrants an additional comment on another blog.  On the way back, we are greeted by Spirit Airlines charging us once again with the outrageous bag charges, but there was another charge coming our way.  They wanted to charge us for my Wife's carry on that they did not charge us for on our way out of Vegas.  $50 was the price they told us they charged and that we should have charged.  My Wife was not having it at this point; they had pushed her too far.  The individual working the counter explained that the inconsistent charges were unfortunate but there was nothing she could do about it and explained that if we did not pay the $50 at the desk we would pay $100 at the gate.  Once again my Wife was not impressed.  So, she asked to speak to a Supervisor, and we waited 15 minutes for her to show up.  The Supervisor offered very little to the conversation.  She did explain that we could pay online at Spirits website and it would be only $35.  My Wife whips out her smart phone, brings up the website and it will not work.  The Supervisor takes the phone and cannot navigate through the website herself.  She then explains that we can call Spirit at the number on the back of our boarding pass and they can give us the discounted baggage fee.  So, my Wife dials up the number and what do you know, the number has changed.  Finally we get the right number and call, we get the $35 charge and get on our way.  A few additional observations, seats were terribly uncomfortable and would not recline, Flight Attendants run off at the mouth in a poor display of Flight Attendant professionalism, and 40lbs max for your checked baggage, which may be standard across the board.  One of the worst parts of this situation, is that I paid for this service and treatment.  I paid hundreds of dollars to be treated poorly.   \n  So, overall, my recommendation for you would be, pay the extra money on another airline, take the layovers, it is all worth it in the end.  My family will never fly Spirit airlines again period.  Over all ticket price $635, overall baggage charges $335, hopefully toasting my Wife on the moment Spirit Airlines goes out of business.................PRICELESS.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-05-20","useful":0,"counts":{"all":3,"show":1,"money":1,"over":1,"through":1,"thanks":1,"seats":1,"go":1,"once":2,"poorly":1,"$":9,"with":4,"explain":1,"point":1,"royal":1,",":25,"should":1,"blog":1,"to":13,"finally":1,"4":1,"combo":1,"whips":1,"uso":1,"has":1,"worth":1,"smart":1,"take":1,"then":2,"goes":1,"get":4,"far":1,"blanket":1,"overall":2,"number":4,"vegas":2,"worst":1,"know":1,"they":6,"desk":1,"not":8,"ticket":1,"tickets":1,"like":1,"did":3,"50":2,"bag":1,"she":4,"told":1,"inconsistent":1,"right":1,"cruise":2,"we":15,"past":1,"professionalism":1,"individual":1,"are":2,"uncomfortable":1,"pass":1,"our":10,"port":1,"out":4,"outrageous":1,"what":1,"caribbean":1,"spirits":1,"for":9,"..priceless":1,"3":1,"7":1,"hopefully":1,"got":2,";":1,"across":1,"red":1,"bought":1,"be":4,"notice":1,"recline":1,"run":1,"business":1,"never":1,"standard":1,"hours":1,"eye":1,"100":1,"wanted":1,"by":1,"additional":3,"on":10,"about":1,"working":1,"luggage":1,"of":7,"could":2,"changed":1,"35":2,"display":1,"conversation":1,"connection":1,"her":3,"mccarran":1,"soda":1,"40lbs":1,"or":1,"waited":1,"ft.":1,"comment":1,"dials":1,"family":1,"extra":1,"335":1,"had":1,"warrants":1,"explained":2,"period":1,"one":1,"another":3,"carry":1,"your":1,"speak":1,"impressed":1,"little":1,"fee":1,"checked":1,"takes":2,"service":1,"attendant":1,"there":2,"charge":4,"been":1,".":28,"few":1,"hundreds":1,"call":2,"too":1,"way":4,"which":2,"was":8,"board":1,"website":3,"from":1,"only":1,"flight":5,"635":1,"offer":1,"started":1,"brings":1,"offered":1,"delayed":1,"but":3,"back":2,"phone":2,"observations":1,"...":5,"off":1,"toasting":1,"herself":1,"spirit":5,"fly":1,"boarding":1,"15":1,"pillow":1,"this":3,"work":1,"up":3,"us":5,"will":2,"charges":5,"outstanding":1,"can":3,"were":3,"situation":1,"problem":1,"treated":1,"dollars":1,"at":7,"and":17,"attendants":1,"would":6,"supervisor":3,"do":2,"navigate":1,"is":2,"recommendation":1,"it":7,"an":1,"pushed":1,"experience":1,"have":2,"in":2,"my":9,"give":1,"if":2,"huge":2,"end":1,"terribly":1,"pay":4,"that":9,"treatment":1,"very":1,"parts":1,"airlines":4,"unfortunate":1,"online":1,"gate":2,"you":2,"explains":1,"charging":1,"airline":1,"poor":1,"'s":1,"again":3,"may":1,"max":1,"price":2,"layovers":1,"overweight":1,"vacation":1,"paid":2,"greeted":1,"pathetic":1,"moment":1,"mouth":1,"coming":1,"nothing":1,"fl":1,"a":7,"purchase":1,"volunteers":1,"discounted":1,"minutes":1,"wife":6,"i":2,"counter":1,"asked":2,"baggage":3,"so":4,"the":35,"charged":2,"having":1,"lauderdale":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

Booked through Expedia and found a decent fair not a 9 dollar fare or what is advertise on the Spirit website. You pay for what you get. But a 300 dollar round trip from lax to Las Vegas is far from discount travel. Traveling to on United airlines no issues as usual but a return on Spirit a nightmare that never ended. Had a original take off of 1145 to Lax . Tell me why when I got to the airport 2 1\/2 hours before my flight the other three flights from Spirit where all delayed. I stayed positive and said to myself \" this is just a routine flight done every day back and forth from lax and Las Vegas\". What could possible go wrong other than maybe a back up on the runway. Guess what 5 hour delay to Lax on a direct flight.  Guess what same thing for San diego and Oakland and a cancelation for Denver. Guess what no other flights in terminal 2 going out so that means from 930 ish in the am until I actually got on the plane 5 hours past my initial take off nothing was flying out for Spirit. Suppose it was a weather related. Guess what Spirit I'm not just a sheep that will follow you blindly and with all the free time i had I checked all the other airlines and didn't see any cancelations to or from Denver and or delays . I could have actually rebooked with other airlines but for 1000+ for a one hour trip and I guess it wasn't the end of the world and justify paying 2 grand for two flights to lax.

Legs are bent at strange angles,  babies crying, the elderly snoring like as asthmatic hippos's. We all lie here hoping desperately that our delayed plane may wander into the airport within the next 6 years.. As a frequent flyer I have just seen my first passenger wrapped in a trash bag, waiting for our mysterious plane to appear, desperately hoarding warmth, knowing we could be here for New Year (it's sept 21st). The spirit airlines staff did their best to allay our fears, but due to their general lack of knowledge or customer service skills no information is forthcoming. They did however inform me my flight, or should I say 'alleged flight' is oversold.. So I guess I'm lucky to be here. I'm dreaming of the day we board so I can sit in my $15 dollar assigned seat and order a $10 diet coke..

I flew from LV to San Diego.  I can handle anything for 1 hour.\n\nOne thing I notice from the posts is the displeasure of seating room and the extra costs.  The seats are tight - no doubt about that but you can add their roomier seats for something like $13 each way & they're huge.  I sat in the regular seats which weren't great but bearable.  I think you have to put things in perspective.  You get what you pay for.  If you want cheap air you're going to give up a little.\n\nAnother thing people complained about is the baggage fees.  If you plan ahead you're good.  Just pay for a checkin bag and you will have no problems. Also, you get a carry on item.  I had a back pack and no one said anything.   Again, this has to do with planning.\n\nI would say if you're looking for a short flight that is half the price of Southwest it's a good deal.  If not then you should book S.W. or some other carrier.  If you are looking for a deal and \"PLAN AHEAD\" then this is a good alternative or if it's last minute you can save a little.  \n\nNow that being said the worst thing I can say is I didn't care for the staff.  No smiles, little bit of attitude etc.  - oh and french accents for the whole staff (kinda annoying).  \n\nThe biggest annoyance is the people who sat near me and complained or made snide remarks about the extra costs and fees.  People - you have a choice.  This isn't some third world country where you only have one nationalized airline.  You can book somewhere else.  If you book it deal with it just don't get on a cheap flight acting like you're a priority first class passenger.  You're going cheap know your place.\n\nHope this helps.  good luck.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":4,"date":"2012-06-05","useful":6,"counts":{"perspective":1,"all":1,"just":2,"being":1,"cheap":3,"attitude":1,"planning":1,"seats":3,"alternative":1,"staff":2,"$":1,"tight":1,"somewhere":1,"(":1,"had":1,",":3,"should":1,"lv":1,"to":4,"add":1,"going":2,"helps":1,"has":1,"hope":1,"southwest":1,"then":2,"good":4,"handle":1,"get":3,"checkin":1,"flew":1,"choice":1,"worst":1,"know":1,"they":1,"half":1,"not":2,"world":1,"bit":1,"now":1,"minute":1,"freaking":1,"snide":1,"like":2,"did":1,"posts":1,"bag":1,"bad":1,"each":1,"where":1,"luck":1,"seating":1,"deal":3,"people":4,"some":2,"back":1,"s.w":1,"are":2,"displeasure":1,"'s":3,"out":1,"will":1,"what":1,"said":2,"for":8,"item":1,"nationalized":1,"looking":2,"acting":1,"reading":1,"notice":1,"were":1,"french":1,"put":1,"care":1,"on":2,"great":1,"last":1,"anything":2,"oh":1,"of":3,"thing":3,"carrier":1,"place":1,"airline":1,"whole":1,"think":1,"bearable":1,"first":1,"extra":2,"one":3,"another":1,"fees":2,"carry":1,"your":1,"annoyance":1,"little":3,"from":3,"would":1,"&":1,"give":1,"only":1,".":30,"priority":1,"their":1,"doubt":1,"way":1,"save":1,"biggest":1,"was":1,"is":7,"a":12,"``":1,"flight":3,"that":4,"about":4,"but":3,"else":1,"with":2,"me":1,"13":1,"made":1,"ahead":2,"hour":1,"this":4,"up":1,"air":1,"reviews":1,"near":1,"'re":6,"can":5,"country":1,"my":1,"pack":1,"and":7,"passenger":1,"san":1,"do":2,"accents":1,"it":5,"''":1,"n't":4,"say":2,"something":1,"have":4,"in":2,"annoying":1,"sat":2,"again":1,"want":1,"etc":1,")":1,"things":1,"-":3,"1":1,"also":1,"other":1,"diego":1,"which":1,"you":20,"if":7,"smiles":1,"roomier":1,"book":3,"huge":1,"price":1,"who":1,"problems":1,"regular":1,"plan":2,"kinda":2,"remarks":1,"class":1,"complained":2,"short":1,"third":1,"room":1,"i":10,"no":4,"or":3,"baggage":1,"costs":2,"honestly":1,"pay":2,"the":14},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

The manager did not offer to compensate a thing for us. Our best option was to rent a car and drive 2 hours to the next airport to catch a flight home. Spirit did not pay for the rental car, all they offered was for us to lay on their floor in the airport.

I flew with them last week.  I was flying with my 10 pound dog.  I got an airline approved carrier, took him to the vet to get a health certificate and health tests and called the airline to let them know I was traveling with a small dog.  I was on hold 26 minutes before anyone answered the phone to take care of the pet fees.  They charged me $100 each way, which made his ticket more than mine and he had to slide under the seat.  The lady on the phone told me that it would show up on my boarding pass that he was traveling with me and all I had to do was to go to the kiosk and check in and then proceed from the gate from there.  So that's how I budgeted the time I needed at the airport.\n\nOk so none of the kiosks at the airport worked for Spirit so I had to trek to the counter to check in.  What is this?  There are crowds of people in front of Spirit and everyone is stressed out.  I realize there is no way I can make my flight and I am desperately looking for an airline employee to discuss my options with but Spirit provided no one for all these people to speak with.  Turns out many of the flights were delayed.  After making a turn through the waiting line I can then see a departing flights board and I realize that my flight is very delayed.  \n\nThe flight is FOUR AND A HALF HOURS LATE.  I received no text message, no phone call, no notice from the airline.  I still had to work my way through this horrendous line.  The other airlines when there is a problem like this will generally have an airline representative come out and direct customers and assist them.  \n\nOh and when I booked there was no mention of the $45 bag fee.  That is for each way!  Carry ons get charged also!  Think about it, you're traveling and they want $90 because you have a suitcase.  For that price how about carrying it out to my car?  Wow.\n\nThose add on fees do not give you a true comparison of trip expense when you are making choices on which airline to travel.  That's ok.  I can fix that by not flying with this airline again.  Enjoy those fees because that's the last you will get from me.  \n\nWhen I finally did get my boarding pass, there was no mention at all about my pet traveling with me.  As a pet owner, that frightens me.  If the pet were to get separated from me, shouldn't the information be on my boarding pass as per the lady I waited 26 minutes to speak to told me?\n\nOh and on the flight after they load you in as cattle, the guy behind me begins to grind his knees into the back of my seat which was more than just uncomfortable.

What was the excuse for all the other days prior? On top of that they charge for everything, you can't even get water without being charged. Seats are also small and cramped, and mind you I'm not that big but seats still sucked. \n\nThey didn't even announce to the passengers that if you keep your flight stub and call them they would credit you $50.00 (sucky compensation if you ask me but still better than nothing) for your next flight because of the long delay (not that I would book with them again). Instead I heard this from a nice gentleman that made it his mission to announce it. \n\nThe only saving grace was that they hired the right flight attendant, Hector, I believe was his name.

Our flights was supposed to take off at 8:30 but it was delayed until 9 PM, once we got on the plane the airplane came to take off but they said there was some type of a problem and the airplane was put on hold for about another 30 minutes and then it came to take off again but the same mechanical issues again. So the flight that should've took off at 8:30 ending up taking off at almost at 10 PM and landing in la around 11 pm. Worst airline I have ever seen in my entire life.

upon a time, in Las Vegas, NV, a couple booked a well-deserved vacation to Cancun, Mexico for their fifth wedding anniversary.  The trip was paid for with their hard earned money, they even splurged for good seats on Spirit Airlines for their trip.  They arrived at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport with all of their necessary documentation and even printed their boarding passes at home to avoid unnecessary charges at the airport.  They even made sure their luggage was not over the required forty (40) pounds per bag as required by Spirit Airlines.  All went well.  The flight departed as scheduled, and they were off to a glorious vacation!\nWhen they arrived at Detroit Airport, they only had forty (40) minutes until their connecting flight to Cancun, Mexico.  That was no problem, because the flight even landed a little bit early, and the gate they were departing from was very close.  When they deplaned, it was discovered that the flight to Cancun had been delayed for three hours.  Not a problem, it would give them time to eat a bite before their flight.  After about an hour, they checked the departing flight board and to their surprise, the Cancun flight had been CANCELLED!  When they asked a Spirit Airlines employee what the issue was, the employee rudely responded with, \"Go downstairs to baggage claim and they will re-book you.\"\nThey went downstairs to baggage claim and were greeted by an exceptionally long line of one hundred and fifty (150) people, waiting to be re-booked.  During their wait, they were never told what exactly happened to our flight except that there were \"mechanical problems.\"  They assumed the plane was broken, so they continued to wait in line for FOUR HOURS, while TWO people were handling the re-booking of the one hundred and fifty (150) passengers.  They were offered no water, no snacks, and no explanation regarding anything.  After the long wait, they were put on another airline to complete their trip, but not until the NEXT DAY.  \nEven though Spirit Airlines paid for their hotel and gave them meal vouchers, they still lost a night in fabulous Cancun, Mexico which cost approximately $450.00 and plenty of happiness.  They later found out that the flight was cancelled due to a \"crew issue.\"  Lie #1 from Spirit Airlines.\rThe next day, the couple continued their trip to Cancun, Mexico on American Airlines (which they also had to pay $50.00 for their luggage) and arrived without issue.  Their vacation was fabulous, but like all good things, it came to an end.  The couple arrived at Cancun Airport and boarded Spirit Airlines flight number NK-240 to Ft. Lauderdale to catch flight NK-777 back to Las Vegas, Nevada.  The flight went well, and they even landed a bit early in Ft. Lauderdale.  Suddenly, a flight attendant came on the loud speaker to tell them that they had to hold the passengers on the plane for twenty (20) minutes because customs was backed up.  This wasn't a huge deal at first, as the connecting flight to Las Vegas wasn't for an hour and forty minutes.  Little did they know, Spirit Airlines had a glitch in their computers and reported that there were ten (10) American citizens on that flight instead of the one hundred and ninety (190) that were actually on the aircraft.  The couple ended up missing the connecting flight to Las Vegas.  Distraught, they went to the Spirit Airlines desk and were told they could only book them on a flight the NEXT DAY, which wouldn't get them home until 5:00 p.m.  This particular couple has to work for a living (hence the mention of hard earned money in the first paragraph) and they needed some time to get their life back in order to return to work Monday morning.  This option was not acceptable and they asked for a refund.  The customer service agent stated she would refund this leg of the trip and it would take seven (7) to ten (10) business days to receive.  They called a family member in Las Vegas and found an American Airlines flight leaving early the next morning and would get them to Las Vegas at noon on June 18, a day later than anticipated.\rThe couple was then burdened with finding a hotel room in Ft. Lauderdale, which Spirit stated they would not help with because the delay was, \"Not their fault.\"  Lie #2 from Spirit.  I know this because a recently received email from their customer service department stated they missed their flight due to \"inclement weather.\"  We all know this is another LIE.  Lie #3 from Spirit. \rThe couple found a hotel that had a shuttle and were able to get a few hours of sleep before flying to Las Vegas the next day.  \rThis concludes my story about the vacation the couple experienced.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2016-06-26","useful":4,"counts":{"refund":2,"all":4,"mexico":4,"departed":1,"departing":2,"money":2,"over":1,"desk":1,"crew":1,"forty":3,"discovered":1,"ended":1,"sleep":1,"seats":1,"go":1,"still":1,"fifth":1,"before":2,"delay":1,"20":1,"$":2,"earned":2,"(":11,"had":7,",":40,"take":1,"eat":1,"to":35,"only":2,"board":1,"employee":2,"has":1,"gate":1,"happened":1,"scheduled":1,"then":1,"them":6,"good":2,"return":1,"get":4,"very":1,"couple":8,"vouchers":1,"anticipated":1,"early":3,"mention":1,"vegas":8,"know":3,"they":30,"wedding":1,"not":6,"during":1,"bit":2,"fifty":2,"continued":2,"day":5,"four":1,"regarding":1,"necessary":1,"like":1,"lost":1,"pounds":1,"did":1,"unnecessary":1,"detroit":1,"morning":2,"bag":1,"ninety":1,"she":1,"though":1,"night":1,"found":3,"went":4,"boarded":1,"meal":1,"lie":4,"because":4,"cost":1,"deal":1,"people":2,"there":2,"hard":2,"some":1,"back":2,"upon":1,"burdened":1,"concludes":1,"home":2,"out":1,"even":6,"450.00":1,"what":2,"nevada":1,"missed":1,"for":12,"avoid":1,"leg":1,"anniversary":1,"per":1,"when":3,"waiting":1,"paragraph":1,"connecting":3,"happiness":1,"7":1,"it":4,"distraught":1,"issue":3,"email":1,"50.00":1,"told":2,"be":1,"nk-240":1,"re-booking":1,"recently":1,"business":1,"missing":1,"problems":1,"never":1,"little":2,"hours":3,"reported":1,"aircraft":1,"will":1,"put":1,"from":5,"attendant":1,"greeted":1,"finding":1,"by":2,"wait":3,"baggage":2,"passengers":2,"about":2,"would":6,"anything":1,"broken":1,"receive":1,"fault":1,"could":1,"citizens":1,"exceptionally":1,"days":1,"leaving":1,"airport":4,"airline":1,"mccarran":1,"assumed":1,"hence":1,"loud":1,"asked":2,"glorious":1,"ft.":3,"rudely":1,"#":3,"deplaned":1,"family":1,"claim":2,"suddenly":1,"number":1,"one":3,"backed":1,"weather":1,"approximately":1,"another":2,"actually":1,"re-book":1,"documentation":1,"and":24,"passes":1,"story":1,"checked":1,"ten":2,"service":2,"re-booked":1,"twenty":1,"bite":1,"snacks":1,"two":1,"long":2,"next":5,"spirit":11,"few":1,"2":1,"time":3,"hundred":3,"was":15,"until":3,"well-deserved":1,"3":1,"life":1,"flight":19,"complete":1,"on":9,"with":5,"flying":1,"offered":1,"hotel":3,"due":2,"delayed":1,"but":2,"190":1,"nk-777":1,"landed":2,"department":1,"lauderdale":3,"particular":1,"catch":1,"off":1,"line":2,"hold":1,"downstairs":2,"than":1,"customer":2,"boarding":1,"handling":1,"were":12,"room":1,"hour":2,"this":7,"18":1,"also":1,"luggage":2,"up":2,"tell":1,"work":2,"charges":1,"while":1,"fabulous":2,"three":1,"of":8,"cancelled":2,"problem":2,"gave":1,"my":1,"called":1,"help":1,"150":2,"seven":1,"computers":1,"we":1,"stated":3,"minutes":3,"is":1,"received":1,"glitch":1,"``":5,"agent":1,"an":5,"''":5,"n't":3,"as":3,"p.m":1,"at":7,"in":9,"close":1,"been":2,"explanation":1,"made":1,"their":20,"splurged":1,"option":1,"!":2,"huge":1,"end":1,"able":1,"no":4,")":11,"things":1,"that":9,"water":1,"american":3,"40":2,"trip":5,"member":1,".":38,"book":1,"speaker":1,"airlines":10,"which":4,"shuttle":1,"instead":1,"you":1,"acceptable":1,"nv":1,"10":2,"responded":1,"required":2,"experienced":1,"monday":1,"living":1,"our":1,"surprise":1,"cancun":7,"after":2,"june":1,"vacation":4,"paid":2,"customs":1,"sure":1,"plane":2,"arrived":4,"printed":1,"plenty":1,"mechanical":1,"without":1,"needed":1,"las":8,"a":24,"booked":1,"give":1,"i":1,"later":2,"well":2,"except":1,"5:00":1,"order":1,"inclement":1,"exactly":1,"1":1,"so":1,"pay":1,"international":1,"the":42,"first":2,"noon":1,"came":2,"once":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

I looked at the website with all my exact specifications and they said it would be $25 for a carry-on. Fine. I'll pay it. It ended up being $45 for the carry-on. I already have a problem with airlines charging for a carry-on, but $45? Airline robbery. When all was said and done, I ended up paying $4 less than if I would have just flown Alaska. Not worth it. Not to mention the flight itself was so scary I thought I was going to die. The plane does not feel safe.

it has been more than a year and a half since my review of Spirit Airlines and I think the honeymoon is over. Sure, you can't really find a cheaper fare, but at some point you have to factor in the convenience factor and the way you are treated. I fly (used to fly) this airline six or eight times per month without fail between Las Vegas and San Diego. Two flights in a row now have been delayed by well more than an hour, which I've come to almost expect because of the low fares. My most recent experience and subsequent response from Spirit's cooporate office has prompted me to update my review to a lowly, one-star rating.\n\nMy experience Friday night, June 5, 2015, while attempting to fly out of Las Vegas was some of the worst customer service I have encountered, ever! My ticket was purchased ahead of time for the evening flight out of Las Vegas. I usually check-in online and print my boarding pass when flying out of Las Vegas and use the kiosk to check-in and print my boarding pass when flying out of San Diego. I make this trip frequently and I am very familiar with the procedures when it comes to getting through security and boarding the plane. I know how long it takes and how much time I need to allow myself.\n\nOften times, I get to the San Diego airport less than an hour before departure, check-in at the kiosk and print my boarding pass. This has worked so well in the past, and is so convenient, that I attempted to do the same on Friday night out of Las Vegas.  When I got to the kiosk at about the same time the boarding process had begun, it would not print my boarding pass and told me that I had to see a ticket agent. I proceeded to the ticket counter and was told that the flight was \"closed\" and that it had closed at 4:30pm, nearly two hours before the scheduled departure time of 6:16pm. \n\nThe ticket agent informed me she would have to get permission from a supervisor to \"open\" the flight. I was informed that the supervisor denied this and I was told that I would not be able to get on that flight. The boarding process had just begun and there was no line at security. There was plenty of time for me to get to the gate. Like I mentioned, I take this flight on a regular basis and know how long it takes to get through security and board the plane.\n\nI can understand if I was trying to purchase a ticket at the last minute, but this ticket was bought and paid for. I was not asking for them to hold the plane. I was not asking for anything other than the ticket I had already purchased. I was told, had I already checked in online they could send me straight to the gate. There was plenty of time for me to get to the gate and make the flight. Again, all I wanted was the ticket that I had already purchased. Why did the supervisor not \"check me in\" and let me get my boarding pass? This could have been accomplished in a matter of seconds and Spirit would have retained a satisfied customer for life. There was absolutely no reason for me to be denied. All I wanted was a ticket that was already purchased. At that point it would have been solely my responsibility to make it to the gate prior to the completion of the boarding process. I did not have to check any bags and there was no line at security.\n\nI asked to speak to a supervisor and was told I could do so after a short wait. I waited more than thirty minutes before one of the agents realized I hadn't spoken to a supervisor yet. She went to get the supervisor, but returned to tell me the supervisor couldn't see me for two or three hours because of a situation regarding cancelled flights and informed me the supervisor wasn't going to be able to do anything for me anyway, stating Spirit is s totally non-refundable airline.\n\nNowhere is it posted near the kiosk that you must check-in nearly two hours prior to your flight. I used the kiosk for convenience and missed my flight because of it. Why is the kiosk procedure not consistent between airports? On the boarding pass printed online, it states \"Reservations are subject to cancellation if you are not at the gate at least 15 minutes prior to departure for domestic flights.\"  I would have been at the gate well before that, had I just been given the ticket I had paid for. \n\n\"Home of the Bare Fare\" should not mean a lack of common sense and customer service.  Of all the things out of your control when it comes to business, the one thing you can control is customer service. Spirit Airlines failed to do so and it cost them a customer.\n\nI wrote to Spirit detailing my issue and their response deflected everything back onto me. They didn't acknowledge that they could have made this right and didn't even address the fact that I was told a supervisor couldn't see me and really couldn't do anything for me anyway.

Not realizing that spirit has a bad reputation in customer services. I thought I got lucky with the quote of $57.00 one way in such a short notice flight. I continued on with the necessary procedure to book my flight@ $114.00 round trip including tax and fees. Spirit has a luggage policy one free carry on by the degree of 16\" by 12\"  any additional luggage cost you and exceeding price of  55.00 to 100.00 per luggage providing you check-in on line otherwise additional fees are apprehended upon your arrival. I thought no problem, to save money I will take advantage of the free carry on and pack smart, I did and got away with rolling all the attire in a large 16\" leather bag handy of stretch clothes and a few toiletries. It work out find. so far I am feeling good about the airlines. I arrive on time the flight left on time and we turbulence wasn't to bad awful and we arrived in Vegas safe. \"Go Spirit I say\" It wasn't until the returning flight home that I found troubling with the spirit airline. I was scheduled to come home the evening of Thursday October 29th the flight was delayed. I thought no problem, I had my rental for a extra day so I decided to stay a extra day and come home on Friday, I arrive to the airport to find out that my flight was delayed again, I said ok no problem\" I will wait. I waited along with other wondering passenger. time begin to move slow then it seem before time pass we were still in the waiting status. over the intercom flight attendants would apologize for the delay but still no flight leaving out to comfort our trip back home. time now moving fast and before I knew it midnight arrived and over the intercom it was told not only was the flight delayed it had been cancelled for that flight out. The awaiting passengers young, old disabled and families were utterly surprised. question and concerns arise. what do we do? where do we go? How will spirit accommodate? we got very few answers and a whole lot of lies. one man said. The flight attendant only said we must re book a flight for tomorrow and hope a flight is available\" \" hurry and do it now before  none or left\" some passenger ran ranting down the way and some got on phones and some stayed to bitch. needless to say by the time arrived down to the what seem a 4milke stretch to the counter to rebook there were no available flight out until the following evening. this left me carless hotel - less and I had to rely on a cousin who was in bed sleep to come and what felt like a rescue mission to come save my ass from the airport. never the less I got out of the airport but what was sad though to see some elder and others with lack of accommodation with left no choice but to stay at the MCCARRAN INTL.

Of course that raised a red flag, so I did some research, starting with reviews and ending with reviews. It only took 15 minutes of reading the reviews to see what's in store. Yes, the airfare is super cheap. Yet you have to pay for everything else. Including water, coffee, a biscuit, etc. At the time I wondered if there was a charge for using the restrooms. I chose to fly spirit anyway and see how they roll. I was more than pleasantly surprised with their customer service on both flights. As for punctuality, the initial flight departed on time and arrived early. The return flight departed (was airborne) over an hour late yet arrived at destination only 40 minutes or so after scheduled time. Both flights had professional staffs and great captains. At the check in counter for my bag on the return flight I was notified that if you use the kiosk there is currently no charge for printing your boarding pass. He did say they will start charging soon but its a negligible amount. On the initial flight I payed the $50 for the front row seat and had the leg room, etc. (There is no \"first class\" when the airfare is that low) 2nd flight I paid $18 for an aisle seat further back. Knew what to expect and still was pleasantly surprised. I do have one issue. On the first flight, knowing that all planes in transit would be better served using a credit or debit card, well that's all I had. In their introduction they stated that they didn't have a card reader. All on board purchases would have to be cash. I didn't have cash. What would happen if I were dehydrated and in need of nutrition with a debit or credit card that could provide me what I need to get through my 4 hr trip? Remember they charge for water. On this trip they stated that this is not the normal process. I.e. it doesn't happen often. Guess what, on my return trip, no card reader, same explanation.  Hmm. That is why they get 3 instead of 4 stars.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2014-09-22","useful":0,"counts":{"all":3,"departed":2,"over":1,"cheap":1,"anyway":1,"restrooms":1,"course":1,"including":1,"40":1,"yes":1,"still":1,"yet":2,"row":1,"$":2,"(":2,"had":3,",":14,"than":1,"late":1,"to":6,"charge":3,"board":1,"surprised":3,"scheduled":1,"fly":1,"coffee":1,"return":3,"get":2,"debit":2,"soon":1,"early":1,"they":7,"airfare":2,"front":1,"using":2,"ticket":1,"ending":1,"reading":1,"notified":1,"50":1,"roll":1,"payed":1,"bag":1,"?":1,"served":1,"round":1,"often":1,"there":3,"some":1,"back":1,"seat":2,"see":2,"expect":1,"pass":1,"further":1,"happen":2,"reviews":3,"what":5,"for":8,"currently":1,"research":1,"dehydrated":1,"everything":1,"3":1,"does":1,"reader":2,"staffs":1,"issue":1,"red":1,"knowing":1,"be":2,"after":1,"recently":1,"chose":1,"do":1,"leg":1,"planes":1,"use":1,"water":2,"i.e":1,"super":1,"card":4,"aisle":1,"about":1,"service":1,"country":1,"biscuit":1,"so":2,"through":1,"credit":2,"amount":1,"or":3,"first":2,"raised":1,"initial":2,"transit":1,"one":1,".":29,"your":1,"better":1,"guess":1,"would":3,"their":2,"introduction":1,"destination":1,"flights":2,"airborne":1,"captains":1,"start":1,"of":4,"low":2,"stars":1,"was":7,"store":1,"4":2,"nutrition":1,"``":1,"only":2,"flight":6,"both":2,"hr":1,"explanation":1,"kiosk":1,"great":1,"but":1,"else":1,"hmm":1,"flag":1,"provide":1,"with":5,"spirit":2,"he":1,"me":1,"boarding":1,"15":1,"room":1,"hour":1,"this":2,"18":1,"cash":2,"will":1,"printing":1,"were":1,"more":1,"my":3,"could":1,"at":3,"and":8,"purchases":1,"counter":1,"stated":2,"process":1,"minutes":2,"is":6,"it":2,"an":2,"''":1,"n't":3,"say":1,"customer":1,"have":5,"in":5,"need":2,"punctuality":1,"wondered":1,"trip":5,"as":1,"if":3,"etc":2,"not":1,"pay":1,"that":9,"when":1,"cross":1,"same":1,"check":1,"how":2,"instead":1,"you":2,"charging":1,"'s":2,"normal":1,"class":1,"knew":1,"paid":1,"took":1,"did":4,"arrived":2,"on":8,"why":1,"pleasantly":2,"a":9,"booked":1,"remember":1,"i":13,"starting":1,"no":3,"well":1,"2nd":1,")":2,"negligible":1,"time":3,"professional":1,"the":16,"its":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

We all bought $51 round-trip tickets from Oakland to Las Vegas, thinking it was such a steal. No problems booking through Orbitz. Then we find out by going to the Spirit website that there are CARRYON baggage fees. Seriously, wtf? Ok, my bf and I will share one luggage, check it in (which is actually cheaper than carrying it on, by $2 if pre-paid), and our flight is still cheaper than Southwest or Jetblue.\n\n2. Thinking we were all squared away, about 3 weeks before our flight, we get a notice of a flight change, to an earlier time in the morning instead of afternoon as originally scheduled. Slightly inconvenient as we all now have to take the day off work, which is money that could've been made. Fortunately most of our work schedules are flexible. We did not complain to Sprint.\n\n3. About 1.5 weeks before the flight, we got another email saying our flight was changed AGAIN, this time to 6 AM! With 80% of our group coming from San Jose, and Oakland being an hour away, that would require them to leave at 4 AM by the latest. We raised a huge racket, complained on social media and phone calls, and got them to refund one way for everyone except my bf and I (at first they only wanted to give airline CREDIT -- HELL NO, the point of us canceling the flight is because we hate this airline and it's unreliability and extra fees, and we don't intend to ever fly Spirit again!). Everyone else booked a Southwest flight later in the morning. Despite being a week before the flight, it was still only something like $59 one way, and free luggage!\n\n4. My bf and I kept the 6 AM flight, thinking it wasn't too big a deal and we were both taking the day off anyways. Got to the flight counter at 5:15 AM to drop off our luggage and were greeted by a very rude staff. We waited a few minutes while there was obviously one staff who was not doing anything, had to take out a couple pounds from our luggage (40 lb limit, lower than other airlines), and the staff said, \"The counter is already closed. You're late. So basically, HURRY UP.\"\n\n5. Ran through security, ran to the gate, and got checked in. The counter was not closed and there were people still boarding. Overhead bins were mostly empty, the chairs were old and grungy, and the legroom was practically nonexistent (and I'm 5'3\").\n\n6. Everything after that was ok, until the return back. We got to the airport and our gate on time, and our boarding time came and went without any announcements or anything happening. The plane was at the gate, so what could be wrong? One of our friends went to the desk and asked what was going on, and they said, \"There's a delay. We don't know. We work for YOU, not for the airline.\" (wtf?)\n\n7. FINALLY, 1.5 hours later, they allow us to board. We were a little concerned about not having been told anything and thought maybe this was the last day of our lives. =P Just before takeoff, the captain comes on the intercom and says, \"Today's delay was brought to you by...an oil check. It took 10 minutes for the oil check and over an hour to find someone to sign off on it. We apologize for the delay.\" Wow, talk about inefficiency. I'll give it to the captains though on both flights...they were the only seemingly knowledgeable, friendly, and competent people we've dealt with (directly or indirectly) at this entire company.\n\n8. Same old gray and dirty leather seats with nonexistent legroom (felt sorry for my over 6-foot-tall friend, who declared he'll probably just stick with Southwest and Virgin). \n\n9. Got to our destination in one piece, picked up our luggage, which now had a large dent in it, and went home around 1 AM, much too tired to complain about anything anymore.\n\nAnd that is the story of 6 people's first and LAST time with Spirit Airlines. Hardly save any money, and flying Southwest or Virgin will spare you much more headache, discomfort, and rude service. Notice how all the employees at Southwest are so much friendlier and seem happier? Southwest hired all the good ones away.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2012-01-21","useful":5,"counts":{"all":5,"captain":1,"hate":1,"concerned":1,"to":24,"finally":1,"sorry":1,"friendly":1,"southwest":6,"very":1,"seemingly":1,"vegas":2,"tickets":1,"entire":3,"did":1,"leave":1,"booking":1,"dealt":1,"says":1,"tired":1,"sign":1,"likely":1,"picked":1,"takeoff":1,"n't":3,"what":2,"6-foot-tall":1,"goes":1,"new":1,"ever":1,"told":1,"nonexistent":2,"hours":1,"round-trip":1,"change":1,"luggage":5,"employees":1,"changed":1,"credit":1,"airport":1,"advertising":1,"social":1,"extra":1,"brought":1,"from":3,"would":1,"destination":1,"only":3,"few":1,"overhead":1,"6":5,"'s":4,"until":1,"today":1,"more":1,"``":3,"flying":1,"company":2,"phone":1,"carrying":1,"basically":1,"5'3":1,"hurry":1,"fly":1,"hour":2,"this":5,"originally":1,"work":3,"my":5,"non-repeat":1,"give":3,"share":1,"something":1,"want":1,"legroom":2,"attract":1,"jetblue":1,"!":3,"huge":1,"friendlier":1,"fortunately":1,"1":2,"how":1,"instead":1,"airline":3,"orbitz":1,"rude":2,"earlier":1,"discomfort":1,"plane":1,"coming":1,"such":1,"las":2,"a":15,"maybe":1,"counter":3,"baggage":1,"so":3,"allow":1,"bins":1,"refund":1,"over":2,"years":1,"through":2,"hell":1,"still":3,"before":4,"delay":3,"group":2,",":54,"actually":1,"late":1,"weeks":2,"inefficiency":1,"then":1,"them":2,"someone":1,"return":1,"they":4,"gate":3,"not":6,"now":2,"day":3,"drop":1,"--":1,"went":3,"everyone":2,"another":1,"doing":1,"our":13,"80":1,"really":1,"large":1,"squared":1,"seriously":1,"7":1,"got":6,"after":1,"story":1,"free":1,"wanted":1,"could":2,"wrong":1,"waited":1,"first":3,"already":1,"pre-paid":1,"one":6,"directly":1,"fees":2,"0-star":1,"little":1,"checked":1,"service":1,"start":1,"2":2,"too":2,"inconvenient":1,"friend":1,"headache":1,"mostly":1,"that":6,"took":1,"review":1,"kept":1,"than":3,"boarding":2,"10":1,"require":1,"were":8,"are":3,"and":37,"1.5":2,"san":1,"ran":2,"canceling":1,"have":1,"seem":1,"any":2,"take":2,"which":3,"though":1,"who":2,"most":1,"hired":1,"later":2,"dent":1,"talk":1,"yelper":1,"came":1,"saying":1,"=p":1,"find":2,"staff":3,"(":7,"flights":1,"going":2,"money":2,"8":1,"do":2,"get":1,"cheaper":2,"ones":1,"despite":1,"gray":1,"leather":1,"morning":2,"steal":1,"declared":1,"advertised":1,"notice":2,"anyways":1,"racket":1,"said":2,"wow":2,"3":2,"closed":2,"probably":1,"email":1,"bought":1,"we":18,"spare":1,"wtf":2,"competent":1,"lb":1,"both":2,"last":2,"many":1,"taking":1,"asked":1,"comes":1,"point":1,"away":3,"oakland":2,"airlines":3,"been":2,".":51,"much":3,"flexible":1,"hardly":1,"empty":1,"4":2,"website":1,"flight":10,"else":1,"lives":1,"spirit":4,"will":2,"while":1,"is":7,"it":10,"good":1,"in":7,"if":1,"anymore":1,")":7,"media":1,"same":1,"big":1,"9":1,"week":1,"oil":2,"greeted":1,"'ll":2,"complained":1,"lower":1,"off":4,"i":6,"obviously":1,"thought":1,"without":1,"the":38,"latest":1,"just":3,"being":2,"knowledgeable":1,"schedules":1,"seats":1,"jose":1,"$":3,"thinking":3,"had":2,"except":1,"complain":2,"board":1,"fares":1,"save":1,"scheduled":1,"...":2,"customers":2,"around":1,"intercom":1,"couple":1,"know":1,"desk":1,"59":1,"like":1,"pounds":1,"chairs":1,"51":1,"'ve":2,"true":1,"security":1,"carryon":1,"because":1,"old":2,"deal":1,"people":3,"back":1,"home":1,"sprint":1,"for":9,"5:15":1,"everything":1,"?":4,"be":1,"bf":3,"memorable":1,"super":1,"by":5,"on":7,"about":5,"ok":2,"anything":4,"of":9,"afternoon":1,"slightly":1,"or":4,"raised":1,"apologize":1,"there":4,"captains":1,"virgin":2,"unreliability":1,"low":1,"way":2,"was":13,"grungy":1,"with":6,"he":1,"made":1,"up":2,"us":2,"'re":1,"limit":1,"dirty":1,"piece":1,"minutes":2,"am":5,"an":4,"''":4,"as":3,"at":6,"check":3,"again":2,"%":1,"no":2,"40":1,"other":1,"5":2,"branch":1,"announcements":1,"you":4,"out":2,"intend":1,"felt":1,"problems":2,"'m":1,"friends":1,"booked":1,"happier":1,"happening":1,"calls":1,"practically":1,"having":1,"time":6,"indirectly":1,"stick":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

main reason that I left a 1 star (I'd leave 0 if I can) were the charges. Spirit Airlines charges you for anything and everything every step of the way. Here's a brief overview of their charges:\n- Charge to sit next to each other ($5-$15)\n- Charge to CARRY-ON luggage ($35-$45)\n- Charge to CARRY-ON luggage if you didn't pay before security: $100\n- Charge to CHECK-IN luggage ($35-$45)\n- Charge for water\/drinks\/beverages ($3-$7)\n- Get this. Charge for PRINTING YOUR TICKET AT THE CHECK IN DESK ($5)\n\nI am a little miffed about the last one. No airline charges for that. On the trip over to Vegas we made a mistake by not paying for our luggage ahead of time, so it was $45 to check in. To fly back to Oakland we paid for it online ($35 for checked luggage since we paid ahead of time) but we didn't have a printer so we didn't print out our boarding pass. So figures you can just print it at the kiosk or the check in desk when you drop off your luggage right? My partner lined up to go drop off the luggage for check in and asked to print the ticket while at the front. The representative for Spirit said it'll be a $5 to print at the desk whereas it's FREE at the kiosk. Basically, she wasted not only OUR time but the time of the people waiting behind us in line, by basically refusing to service us unless we have a boarding pass. It would've taken less time for her to just print it out for us. We had to get out of line, print boarding pass at kiosk, and then get back in line. \nVery nonsensical.\n\nAlso the airplane itself is very old. Much much older than Southwest. The seats were worn out and it's very obviously so. They constantly disrupt the flight in making announcements for people to get a Mastercard membership with them to get a free ticket, or some promotional program or something. Very annoying and loud. Nothing you'd hear in Southwest.\n\nHorrible experience, never going with Spirit again. We definitely paid more by going on Spirit and had much more unsatisfactory experience. Should've just paid a bit more upfront for Southwest!! Then we could have sat together too (for free!!)\n\n- - - - -\n\nAnother Sad Story of how Horrible it is:\nMy partner and I were going to the gate at Oakland to board the plane to Vegas. On our way in, we saw a guy trying to fit his luggage into the \"Free\" slot at the gate. He managed to fit it in, but it was a little over the edge (maybe an inch above). The Spirit airline representatives were very stubborn and very un-sympathetic. They said it doesn't fit all the way in. Since it didn't fit all the way in, it was $100 to carry on the plane if you pay at the gate. My partner and I went through the gate, and didn't hear the rest of the conversation. Turns out 10 minutes later, that guy was actually seated behind me. What happened was, he ended up taking all of his clothing out of his suitcase and just stuffed it in a bag, and brought it on the plane. He ditched his suitcase because it was ridiculous to pay $100 to carry it on. Yet there were plenty of empty luggage compartments above us throughout the plane. Why did that 1 inch matter? The service representatives at spirit are ruthless!!\n\nLesson here? Be careful when you're flying Spirit (try not to even fly it at all). Make sure to measure your bags.

Find out our flight is over booked, which delayed boarding another 20 minutes. My husband and I volunteered to get off the flight since we really wanted to go back to NY in stead of Philly. So when we volunteered we said we'll only give up our tickets if our bags are taken off the plane, which wasn't a big request since they hadn't even put the bags on the plane yet according to the guy we spoke too. He said yes no problem, and he'd be right back to re-book us.\n\nHe came back after an hour and a half and than stated he couldn't re-book us, we had to walk down to another gate (from B17 to B2)  to meet his manager. We asked about our luggage and he told us to go to carousel 12 to get them after being re booked. His manager stated she'd be back shortly once we got there and we waited another 30 minutes.\n\nAfter being re-booked, getting our flight vouchers and our meal tickets and hotel info we went down to collect our bags only to find out that they were never taken off the plane, they guy who said they were didn't even put in a request, and just made up a carousel number to get us to get off the plane. We were told we'd have to go to Philly to pick them up ourselves.\n\nAfter fighting with spirit and getting the wonderful Jetblue to help us, spirit agreed to send our bags overnighted to our home. That was two days ago, and we still don't have our bags. \n\nHow is this airline still in business? We have free flight vouchers, but at this point, why would we use them? I'd rather pay for better service.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-07-10","useful":0,"counts":{"all":1,"help":1,"just":1,"being":2,"over":1,"manager":3,"go":3,"yes":1,"still":2,"yet":1,"20":1,"ny":1,"(":1,"had":3,",":15,"send":1,"spirit":2,"better":1,"to":25,"only":2,"4":1,"agreed":1,"do":1,"them":3,"his":2,"get":4,"big":1,"vouchers":2,"vegas":1,"worst":1,"they":4,"half":1,"not":1,"one":1,"day":1,"tickets":4,"went":1,"did":2,"'ve":1,"collect":1,"stead":1,"she":2,"guy":2,"meal":3,"husband":1,"right":1,"back":4,"traveling":1,"b2":1,"home":2,"ourselves":1,"out":2,"even":2,"said":3,"spirits":1,"for":2,"rep":1,"since":3,"find":2,"re":1,"got":1,"ever":1,"?":2,"told":2,"be":2,"we":16,"give":1,"business":1,"never":1,"free":1,"refused":1,"hours":2,"how":1,"let":1,"response":1,"put":2,"wanted":1,"by":1,"after":4,"on":1,"about":1,"would":1,"eat":1,"luggage":1,"of":1,"could":1,"30":1,"days":1,"experience":1,"plane":4,"overnighted":1,"airline":1,"pick":1,"asked":2,"waited":1,"point":1,"ca":1,"number":1,"walk":1,"down":2,"weather":1,"another":3,"volunteered":2,"re-book":2,"speak":1,"use":1,"from":2,"spoke":1,"service":1,"re-booked":1,"there":1,"two":1,".":16,"wonderful":1,"too":1,"lot":1,"taken":2,"was":5,"a":6,"``":1,"flight":6,"way":1,"that":3,"hotel":1,"delayed":3,"but":1,"regards":1,"off":4,"an":1,"with":2,"than":1,"he":5,"info":1,"boarding":1,"12":1,"hour":1,"this":3,"also":1,"getting":2,"up":3,"us":6,"n't":7,"were":3,"meet":1,"problem":3,"my":2,"are":1,"and":12,"1.5":1,"stated":2,"minutes":2,"is":2,"it":1,"according":1,"''":1,"really":1,"at":1,"have":4,"in":4,"made":1,"philly":3,"jetblue":1,"if":1,"again":1,"'ll":1,"no":1,")":1,"pay":1,"travel":1,"when":2,"b17":1,"carousel":2,"which":2,"gate":1,"you":1,"absolute":1,"'s":3,"bags":5,"our":11,"who":1,"'d":4,"why":1,"las":1,"ago":1,"booked":2,"shortly":1,"i":5,"request":2,"fighting":1,"rather":1,"so":2,"firstly":1,"the":11,"came":1,"once":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

That process for so frustrating.  Not a way to start your vacation.  We lost a day of vacation because of the canceled flight and was not compensated.  Food vouchers and a hotel room would have been nice since we were stuck in the airport for over 11 hrs.  You would think they would do anything to make a bad situation better.  I also paid 100 dollars for our seats and didn't even get those.  Not sure how they stay in business, because the way they treat passengers they obviously do not want repeat customers.  This airline isn't cheaper either.  They nickel and dime you to death.  I am fine with not getting soda or snacks on a flight, but water would be nice.  They will give you a cup of ice for free, but no water, which is ridiculous.  I would never fly this airline again even if it is the last airline on earth.  I would rather drive or walk.

The best kept secret about this airline are their Big Front Seats, which range from $15 to about $65-75 depending on the longevity of the flight. After factoring in the BFS to the price, the fare rivals Delta and kills Southwest in terms of low costs.\n\nThere is one hidden fee about Spirit that most don't know about, which is a $30-35 service charge for booking online (called \"Passenger Usage Fee\" in the flight's price). That can be avoided by going to McCarran and booking over the counter. Had to give them only 4-stars because of their on-time performance, which is among the worst in the industry.

Restricting bag weight to 40 lbs. causes a customer to consider packing lighter than normal, but is a terrible business practice to actually experience. For a visit lasting longer than a few days, many people may experience a $25 overweight charge per bag when packing for their trips.\n\nAs for the customer service I've experienced by the airline at McCarren, I found the service to be friendly and quick with little to no issues during our check in process.\n\nSo if everything is fairly decent why is the airline rated 2 stars?

Everything is tightly packed into a dirty modern airbus that is so tight and lacking amenities it really changed the experience for its fliers. Seats do no recline, gum stains are on the floor, the drink menu offers several options however the plane does not have them in inventory, multiple technical issues with their planes and computer systems prolonging flights, and just an overall experience that lacks what some may expect as common service expectations. \n\n2 stars it's priced well but it is what you are paying for that you need to consider prior to choosing Spirit - a subpar experience with many cut corners fliers have come to expect as a normal flying experience.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":2,"date":"2013-10-08","useful":5,"counts":{"consider":2,"just":1,"stains":1,"when":2,"customer":3,"seats":1,"its":1,"causes":1,"25":1,"cut":1,"$":1,"menu":1,"expectations":1,"actually":1,"presents":1,"to":10,"charge":1,"offers":1,"systems":1,"heavier":1,"friendly":1,"do":1,"them":1,"lacking":1,"very":1,"than":2,"practice":1,"overall":1,"adheres":1,"worst":1,"lighter":1,"not":1,"during":1,"multiple":1,"corners":1,"clientele":1,"gum":1,"'ve":2,"bag":3,"common":1,"quick":1,"found":1,"lasting":1,"who":1,"weight":1,"people":1,"guidelines":1,"some":1,"computer":1,"are":2,"choosing":1,"our":1,"packed":1,"really":1,"what":2,"for":5,"per":1,"everything":2,"does":1,"issues":2,"ever":1,"?":1,"be":1,"drink":1,"business":1,"restricting":1,"however":1,"packing":2,"come":1,"by":1,"on":1,"actual":1,"fliers":2,"technical":1,"many":2,"larger":1,"days":1,"experience":7,"prior":1,"airline":4,"or":1,"subpar":1,"saving":1,"simple":1,"into":1,",":8,"airbus":1,"passes":1,"little":1,"rated":1,"service":3,"few":1,"decent":1,"flying":1,"visit":1,"flights":1,"tightly":1,".":10,"their":4,"2":2,"amenities":1,"stars":2,"strict":1,"flight":1,"that":5,"company":1,"occurred":1,"but":2,"prolonging":1,"with":4,"spirit":1,"paying":1,"terrible":1,"proactively":1,"value":1,"dirty":1,"planes":1,"trips":1,"expect":2,"and":5,"lbs":1,"changed":1,"process":1,"is":9,"modern":1,"mind":1,"it":4,"an":1,"as":3,"itself":1,"at":1,"have":2,"in":4,"need":1,"lacks":1,"check":1,"if":1,"no":2,"-":1,"40":1,"tight":1,"inventory":1,"interior":1,"you":2,"several":1,"fairly":1,"experienced":1,"'s":1,"normal":2,"may":2,"recline":1,"overweight":1,"plane":1,"priced":1,"why":1,"a":10,"longer":1,"i":3,"floor":1,"well":1,"options":1,"cramped":1,"so":2,"mccarren":1,"the":13},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

I had lost my confirmation code on the return flight, and staff jumped right in and assisted me and arranged for both our seats together.  \n\nI will definitely fly again and avoid the long lines with other airlines, too bad Spirit has limited flights and or not too non-stop flights to my choice of destination.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":5,"date":"2012-09-17","useful":0,"counts":{"and":7,"limited":1,"all":1,"because":1,"help":1,"lines":1,"seats":1,"satisfied":1,"due":1,"seen":1,"timing":1,"code":1,"right":1,"at":1,"have":1,"in":1,"our":2,"oakland":1,"any":1,"staff":2,"reviews":1,"from":1,"service":1,"no":1,"jumped":1,"assisted":1,"destination":1,"had":3,",":3,"long":1,".":6,"to":5,"flights":3,"willing":1,"low":1,"fares":1,"has":1,"friendly":2,"too":2,"me":1,"we":4,"confirmation":1,"flight":1,"chose":1,"on":1,"fly":2,"problems":1,"price":1,"never":1,"reps":1,"return":1,"but":1,"number":1,"were":2,"vegas":1,"doubts":1,"not":1,"choice":1,"with":2,"spirit":2,"las":1,"customer":1,"both":1,"arranged":1,"for":1,"lost":1,"avoid":1,"i":3,"of":4,"extremely":2,"airlines":1,"non-stop":1,"will":1,"bad":2,"definitely":1,"so":1,"together":1,"again":1,"the":6,"other":1,"my":2,"or":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

don't even get what you paid for... you get your trip ruined minus your precious time. I will never ride Spirit even if they pay for my flight as my time is more precious. This is the worst airline (or is it even?) I ever flew and I had been on 15+ including many budget airlines all across the world.\n\nI was writing to explain mine and my friend's worst experience in brief, but it became an essay. So don't read below this paragraph unless you really want to. Just believe me and fly other airline, NOT Spirit.\n\nBelow are the experience I had... the worst.... I couldn't even believe\n\n- I woke up 10 min before scheduled departure of my original flight and called spirit for another ticket on later flight that night, after explaining the situation. (100% my fault) Then found out that the flight was actually delayed for 1.5 hr. If they have told me that it was delayed, I probably have made the original flight since MGM is like 5 minutes from airport.\n\n- The next flight at 10 PM that costed $110 was delayed for 1 hr then changed to 2 hr then 4 hr, making me arrive Oakland at 2:55 AM! Plane from Portland was sitting at the departing airport all the time, but I was not told at the counter, or the boarding pass and NOBODY was at the gate until then changing 2 hr delay to 4 hr.\n\n- Things happen and I under stand that. But after check-in, settle in, etc, I will hardly get any sleep at my hotel that costed me almost $200 which was non-refundable, but I rather get some good sleep then continue the next day, so I kindly explained my situation to the attendant at the gate, asking maybe they will push me to next morning and provide me a room. She says things happens we can't control it. Your money is yours. Our is ours. Nope. I just shorten it down, but they were VERY RUDE. No apology at all. Non of this is their fault. At this point I just decided to sleep one more night on my money and move my ticket next morning.\n\n- People were lining up at the gate already, so I thought I will go to the counter and talk to manager about this situation and get my ticket changed at the same time. After explaining about the situation and the rudeness of the staff and etc, not demanding a single thing, just expressing complaints about their service, AND even telling her that all this time non of the staff mentioned any word close to \"sorry\" or \"apologize\" and that's what made me mad and the service should be better and what I get is... the same line from the staff at the gate.. not a single apologize or even a slight expression of it.... \n\n-I give up now. I bet the CEO of Spirit will tell me the same thing. I ask the supervisor if she can change my ticket for tomorrow morning's flight and she \"points\" at the line with 30 people waiting. When I asked her really, she suggests me to pass security walk all the distance to the gate to ask the staff there.\n\n- After talking to Spirit staff on the phone (to make things quicker I thought) for 20 mins and after further lightening my wallet further for taxi and hotel, I flew out about 1 hour after scheduled time the next morning. \n\n- My friend arrived and departed (or supposed to) with Spirit on same route. I get a  text from him before his arrival, 2 hours delay... I get a text from him upon his departure, 2 hrs delay... then flight canceled.... He had to stay over night, couldn't get on the morning flight with Spirit and finally flying back on Southwest at 7 PM.\n\n- Due to my situation and my friend's, I had to check their LAS-OAK route schedule  for about 5 days and they have 2 flights a day. NOT A SINGLE ON TIME. They are all delayed for 40+ minutes and more than half of them like 2 hours or canceled.\n\nI would never fly with Spirit. I would never fly with them even if they give me ticket for free. I would give it a thought if they pay me $500 and bagging them to fly them one more time. If I am alone. But I will refuse if this flight is for an important trip like a marriage. Save yourself. Sorry about the long review. I was just so frustrated.\n\nUPDATE: After reading other reviews, I figured I did not say anything about the quality of their flight onboard. I am 5' 11\" and my legs were pinned at front seat (sorry for the front passenger). The plane was pretty old not in good shape, worse than a propeller plane that I had been on in US two years back. I haven't tried the restroom or other thing, but one thing I noticed while exiting the plane was that two staffs at the gate, and who always say \"thank you for flying with us\", were chatting themselves. At that point I figured, even the employees know it.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2012-12-22","useful":0,"counts":{"essay":1,"all":6,"manager":1,"sleep":3,"go":1,"lining":1,"-i":1,"to":20,"finally":1,"under":1,"sorry":3,"southwest":1,"me":11,"worse":1,"sitting":1,"very":1,"worst":3,"telling":1,"ticket":5,"did":1,"settle":1,"quicker":1,"says":1,"pass":2,"further":2,"even":8,"will":6,"what":3,"schedule":1,"brief":1,"waiting":1,"ever":1,"told":2,"never":3,"hours":2,"alone":1,"100":1,"change":1,"employees":1,"30":1,"experience":2,"exiting":1,"suggests":1,"airport":2,"explained":1,"yourself":1,"from":5,"would":3,"two":2,"next":5,"themselves":1,"until":1,"more":4,"``":4,"flying":2,"it":8,"phone":1,"rudeness":1,"fly":4,"word":1,"room":1,"hour":1,"this":7,"ride":1,"reviews":1,"wallet":1,"paragraph":1,"can":1,"making":1,"arrive":1,"my":16,"route":2,"control":1,"give":3,"want":1,"!":1,"provide":1,"1":2,"gate":5,"airline":2,"costed":2,"tried":1,"rude":1,"after":7,"demanding":1,"plane":4,"mad":1,"a":11,"refuse":1,"maybe":1,"counter":2,"departure":2,"rather":1,"so":4,"things":3,"talk":1,"over":1,"move":1,"years":1,"including":1,"mentioned":1,"before":2,"delay":3,"20":1,"thank":1,"40+":1,",":30,"writing":1,"better":1,"ours":1,"then":6,"non":2,"good":2,"ceo":1,"flew":2,"they":8,"half":1,"front":2,"now":1,"day":2,"always":1,"check-in":1,"found":1,"our":1,"portland":1,"out":2,"'":1,"since":1,"7":1,"free":1,"ask":2,"attendant":1,"could":2,"days":1,"thing":4,"already":1,"bagging":1,"one":3,"another":1,"quality":1,"tomorrow":1,"service":2,"pinned":1,"their":4,"2":6,"legs":1,"friend":3,"that":11,"nobody":1,"believe":2,"than":2,"boarding":1,"distance":1,"2:55":1,"gate..":1,"kindly":1,"marriage":1,"supposed":1,"were":4,"minus":1,"bet":1,"and":27,"1.5":1,"mine":1,"talking":1,"say":2,"have":4,"mins":1,"any":2,"min":1,"-":7,"which":1,"200":1,"hotel":2,"unless":1,"who":1,"paid":1,"complaints":1,"later":1,"points":1,"departing":1,"text":2,"staff":5,"(":5,"explain":1,"hrs":1,"should":1,"flights":1,"pretty":1,"lightening":1,"do":2,"his":2,"get":9,"mgm":1,"onboard":1,"him":2,"frustrated":1,"morning":5,"she":4,"seat":1,"decided":1,"are":2,"close":1,"ruined":1,"review":1,"probably":1,"reading":1,"nope":1,"across":1,"arrival":1,"we":1,"precious":2,"figured":2,"fault":2,"restroom":1,"etc":2,"became":1,"expression":1,"asked":1,"point":2,"ca":1,"walk":1,"oakland":1,"due":1,"been":2,".":47,"hardly":1,"woke":1,"pm":2,"flight":11,"spirit":8,"budget":1,"n't":6,"while":1,"many":1,"situation":5,"changed":2,"almost":1,"is":9,"them":4,"canceled":2,"in":4,"if":7,"non-refundable":1,")":5,"pay":2,"make":1,"shorten":1,"same":4,"trip":2,"upon":1,"arrived":1,"changing":1,"single":3,"i":39,"thought":3,"the":45,"yours":1,"taxi":1,"departed":1,"just":5,"money":2,"not":7,"shape":1,"$":3,"had":5,"4":2,"save":1,"scheduled":2,"...":8,"read":1,"know":1,"propeller":1,"world":1,"like":3,"continue":1,"night":3,"security":1,"old":1,"people":2,"some":1,"back":2,"110":1,"happens":1,"for":14,"asking":1,"expressing":1,"staffs":1,"?":1,"be":1,"slight":1,"on":9,"about":7,"anything":1,"of":8,"stand":1,"or":7,"airlines":1,"down":1,"apologize":2,"actually":1,"your":3,"her":2,"there":1,"long":1,"noticed":1,":":1,"was":11,"chatting":1,"hr":6,"delayed":4,"but":7,"line":2,"with":6,"he":1,"made":2,"happen":1,"up":3,"us":2,"tell":1,"below":2,"500":1,"minutes":2,"called":1,"passenger":1,"supervisor":1,"am":3,"an":2,"''":5,"as":1,"at":17,"15+":1,"check":1,"11":1,"%":1,"no":1,"when":1,"other":3,"5":3,"you":5,"really":2,"10":2,"explaining":2,"'s":4,"update":1,"stay":1,"important":1,"apology":1,"las-oak":1,"time":8,"push":1,"original":2},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

Denver for their first week of service to Denver.. so check it out..\n\nim usually an LV-LA southwest passenger, but i been lookin at spirit lately cuz they have $20 ea way tickets most of the time, but held up getting it cuz ive been using all my SW rapid reward points this whole time.. finally expired so spirit it is.. \n\ni signed up for their $9 fare program since i do fly a lot.. check up on prices.. i found a vegas to denver round trip for under $60!!!!! thats right, under $60!!! u cant even find a 1 way for that cheap! so i said eff it... i dont care where i sit, if they gon take me to denver for under $30 each way ill sit with the luggage for all i care... hahaha i mean how bad can it really be? im going to denver and back for cheaper than a full tank of gas, i really cant complain about anything... \n\nso basically.. im expecting the worst of the worst real shitty service and all that.. but it was actually not bad at all.. the planes (seats i should say) were even better than southwest... more room, and the aircraft was only half full so i had a empty seat next to me... if SW and spirit were the same price and spirit didnt do all that gay stuff wit the charging of extra bags i'd take spirit every time.. the only thing that southwest really has a leg up on spirit is the CHARGING OF THE EXTRA BAGS.. the keyword there is EXTRA... cuz i flew with a pretty large carry on (enough clothes for about a weekend) and there wasnt any problem at all.. (i also stuffed a backpack in there too so when i get out i could put the backpack on, im smart i know) \n\nyea spirit charges extra for like pretty much everything but theres lots of ways to avoid them and id say its definitely worth it considering how cheap i got my tickets for..  like for instance.. \n\nSpirit charges you $5 to print your boarding pass at the ticketing counter.. but to avoid the $5 charge u simply just check in at 1 of those self service kiosks... AWESOME.. it encourages ppl to use the kiosk which speeds checking in by at least half the time.. i think every airline really should do that too... \n\nSpirit charges you for extra carry-on bags and bags... i flew for a 4 day trip to denver, stuffed everything into 1 bag (including my backpack) and boarded the plane no problem, no extra fees.. \n\n\neven tho everybody says spirit charges for everything, they do... but i didnt pay a penny more than my original airfare ticket which came out to sum like $57.58... but from VEGAS to DENVER for under $60 round trip ill take that any day of the week... oh and i also finally booked my LV - LA trip also next week after i finally figured out Spirit is the SHIIIET.. def recommend.. im def flyin spirit again... come on $60 round trip to denver sale... come by again!!! im waitin!!!","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":4,"date":"2012-05-12","useful":0,"counts":{"all":4,"shiiiet..":1,"just":1,"oh":1,"yea":1,"-":2,"57.58":1,"basically..":1,"cheap":2,"years":1,"held":1,"including":1,"seats":1,"recommend..":1,"lately":1,"find":1,"write":1,"rapid":1,"20":1,"$":10,"la":1,"(":4,"backpack":3,"avoid":2,"had":1,"cuz":3,"denver":7,"actually":3,"lv":2,"to":13,"finally":3,"going":2,"4":1,"pretty":2,"under":4,"prices..":1,"has":1,"hahaha":1,"worth":1,"surprised":1,"southwest":3,"real":1,"...":15,"them":2,"get":1,"checking":1,"couple":1,"flew":2,"cheaper":1,"shitty":1,"vegas":2,"worst":2,"know":1,"they":3,"half":2,"not":1,"using":1,"ticket":1,"complain":1,"tickets":2,"like":3,"bags..":1,"kiosks":1,"large":1,"bag":1,"bad":2,"stuff":1,"eff":1,"each":1,"found":1,"airfare":1,"where":1,"round":3,"mean":1,"waitin":1,"right":1,"says":1,"deal":1,"encourages":1,"ea":1,"back":1,"seat":1,"pass":1,"cant":2,"passenger":1,"week":3,"really":4,"even":3,"said":1,"denver..":1,"ticketing":1,"for":16,"lots":1,"sum":1,"since":1,"all..":2,"its":1,"everything":3,"enough":1,"print":1,"got":2,"ever":1,"?":1,"can":1,"be":1,"full":2,"out":3,"leg":1,"were":2,"points":1,"how":2,"aircraft":1,"no":2,"put":1,"come":2,"by":2,"care":2,"on":6,"about":2,"figured":1,"carry-on":1,"anything":1,"getting":1,"of":9,"ill":3,"30":1,"so":7,"thing":2,"'d":1,"expecting":1,"airline":1,"lookin":1,"usually":1,"clothes":1,"whole":1,"think":1,"speeds":1,"thats":1,"this":2,"is..":1,"up..":1,"dont":1,"extra":6,"into":1,")":4,"ppl":1,"60":4,"wit":1,"simply":1,"been":3,"carry":1,"counter..":1,"should":2,"your":1,"everybody":1,"better":1,"use":1,"from":1,"service":3,"expired":1,"there":3,"charge":1,"least":1,"next":2,"their":2,"program":1,"too":2,"stuffed":2,"time":1,"lot..":1,"was":3,"awesome":1,"empty":1,"more":2,",":11,"only":2,"way":3,"gay":1,"that":5,"spirit":14,"gas":1,"but":7,"didnt":2,"with":4,"than":3,"those":1,"me":3,"boarding":1,"tank":1,"room":1,"keyword":1,"for..":1,"luggage":1,"up":4,"signed":1,"i":27,"smart":1,"planes":1,"problem":2,"considering":1,"could":1,"def":2,"theres":1,"and":11,"ive":1,"do":4,"wasnt":1,"is":3,"penny":1,"it":8,"an":2,"fly":1,"say":2,"im":6,"at":6,"have":1,"in":3,"my":5,"gon":1,"id":1,"out..":1,"!":15,"bags":3,"sit":2,"check":3,"pay":1,"self":1,"when":1,"same":1,"that..":1,"1":3,"also":3,"lv-la":1,"5":2,"take":3,"which":2,"9":1,"instance..":1,"you":2,"if":2,"awesome..":1,"charging":2,"day":2,"fare":1,"trip":5,"again":2,"any":2,"kiosk":1,"price":1,"after":1,"time..":3,"much":1,"most":1,"plane":1,"weekend":1,"pleasantly":1,"a":13,"booked":1,"reward":1,"yelp":1,"hookin":1,"charges":4,"flyin":1,"sw":2,"sale":1,"original":1,"tho":1,"ways":1,"definitely":1,"u":2,"boarded":1,"every":2,"the":20,"first":2,"review":2,"came":1,"fees..":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

ACTIVE and RETIRED beware\". \"BLACK\" people of color beware. In my 23 years of MILITARY Service, this was the ABSOLUTE WORST experience I have EVER in my life had. I usually don't write a review but, I felt compelled to warn you all of my experience. Please know that I will never in this lifetime or the next take this airline I urge you to tell friends and family that this is definitely not the airline that you want to take or advise others of cheap fares. I hadn't been on any trips and I decided to take for the New Year a trip with my fiance out to Las Vegas Nevada. I feel too many of the airlines which seem to be too costly once I went on to Priceline and searched our database search Spirit came up and their prices were extremely low everything that's good are everything thats cheap isn't always good please know that. I mistakenly booked our return flight with two connections the original flight coming here was a straight through flights I didn't think to go in and check the next flights after that on the return which was a huge mistake. Once I got closer to us lead and I decide to go in and check out flight to confirm once doing so I seen that we will both to multiple locations I figured that we can get to the airline go standby and have no issues once we got to the airlines and try to go stand by you had a lady named Iris Inn is extremely helpful in Las Vegas Airport McRae international tell her that if it was just one of us being there would be no issues that because it was too there was an issue so we had to sit there and take the flight which had to connections which meant we love that midnight and didn't get home until 2 or 5 o'clock the next day. I made a phone call to the 1- 801 number and found out that they had 12 seats available I was being told that the airline that they had no seats available once I walked all the way back down to the front after going through security I found out that they wasn't doing any standby which is what I was told by a lady named Michelle who was the supervisor. Even had to go back through security with his no issues doing so about me having a military ID card I was able to go straight in which was no problem what's going on the way back I decide to call the 801 number which was their customer service idea was told that they had 12 open seats I went to the gentleman at the gate to confirm and was told that no they only have one we went backwards and forwards with the supervisor on the phone and the desk agents only to find out that they had one open seats I have them confirm me and one open seat and then the problem was I had bad for I had to go back down to the front and then recheck the bags on to the new flight I get down to the front room right back into the supervisor Michelle who was more than upset extremely pissed off that I had gotten a standby I told her I wasn't saying bye will confirm CE they took 20 minutes to go in and find out the system that it wasn't back to confirm seats in doing so she had a very nasty attitudes be a supervisor and I explained to her that I was going to report this I'm not only going to report if you're going to call the 1-800 number and their corporate section and report their actions what size are back upstairs by heard two of the other dates saying that they had somebody which was a shock to hear because if they wasn't doing stand by then why were they calling to stand by a spirit gate 101x the guy and he said they wasn't like doing standbys and he doesn't know why I was so that I can win talk to a supervisor at the Gates who put me in a confirmed seat and also put my mail in a standing position is extremely bad when you have to go backwards and forwards to security just to get something to record that should have been corrected in the first 5 minutes of me access to go standby. I noticed when I was there at the gate I was getting a real nasty little get real nasty attitude from the young lady Michelle it apparently seems to me that it was a racial thing because the people who were checked standby through up here were all white and had no problems going straight through. I was extremely upset and overly pissed  to see you that this is how Spirit treats there  active duty military person I want to warn everybody out there please do not fly spirit for the first bag they charge $35 for the second bag they charge you $72 for carry-on they charge $35 for water juice and crackers on board you charged anywhere between $47 this is by far the worst airline please stay away take heed to what I went through all the frustration this is by far the worst airlines of all of them out there. For all that I paid I could have went first class everything that sounds good isn't always good so please be aware of this airport and their customer service do not fly spirit I repeat DO NOT..\n\nSincerely \nPissed SERVICE MEMBER","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2016-01-04","useful":1,"counts":{"saying":2,"all":6,"they":14,"just":2,"gates":1,"being":2,"please":5,"beware":2,"desk":1,"cheap":2,"actions":1,"years":1,"front":3,"attitude":1,"through":6,"seats":5,"go":10,"retired":1,"nevada":1,"find":2,"issues":3,"customer":2,"write":1,"20":1,"$":4,"took":1,"23":1,"he":2,"should":1,"original":1,"seems":1,"young":1,"spirit":5,"color":1,"flights":2,"going":6,"black":1,"board":1,"my":5,"mistakenly":1,"mail":1,"fares":1,"bye":1,"take":5,"meant":1,"do":4,"them":2,"good":4,"return":2,"12":2,"get":5,"very":1,"midnight":1,"lead":1,"next":3,"have":7,"vegas":2,"compelled":1,"know":3,"decide":2,"new":2,"not":4,"locations":1,"nasty":3,"lady":3,"day":1,"like":1,"service":4,"helpful":1,"did":2,"always":2,"shock":1,"''":2,"able":1,"calling":1,"try":1,"bag":2,"bad":2,"she":1,"heed":1,"found":2,"went":5,"'re":1,"the":44,"because":3,"upstairs":1,"people":2,"doing":6,"problem":2,"back":7,"seat":2,"connections":2,"see":1,"decided":1,"are":2,"year":1,"our":2,"racial":1,"out":8,"even":1,"will":3,"what":4,"said":1,"for":7,"confirm":5,"priceline":1,"section":1,"o'clock":1,"gentleman":1,"overly":1,"felt":1,"access":1,"everything":3,"does":1,"attitudes":1,"then":3,"between":1,"upset":2,"got":2,"ever":1,"told":5,"available":2,"be":4,"we":6,"who":4,"never":1,"here":2,"water":1,"mcrae":1,"if":3,"paid":1,"others":1,"active":2,"from":1,"guy":1,"pissed":3,"``":2,"both":1,"dates":1,"figured":1,"carry-on":1,"getting":1,"fiance":1,"of":11,"could":1,"put":2,"35":2,"thing":1,"airport":2,"101x":1,"airline":5,"standbys":1,"you":9,"usually":1,"military":4,"mistake":1,"or":3,"first":3,"duty":1,"named":2,"love":1,"forwards":2,"noticed":1,"feel":1,"win":1,"into":1,"explained":1,"number":3,"ce":1,"one":4,"down":3,"sincerely":1,"right":1,"agents":1,"family":1,"costly":1,"sounds":1,".":13,"open":3,"size":1,"everybody":1,"once":5,"little":1,"charge":3,"checked":1,"her":3,"to":47,"would":1,"friends":1,"there":7,"urge":1,"system":1,"been":2,"by":7,"their":5,"2":1,"call":3,"card":1,"way":2,"worst":3,"white":1,"las":2,"was":28,"tell":2,"too":3,",":2,"only":3,"flight":5,"frustration":1,"on":7,"corrected":1,"search":1,"but":1,"idea":1,"warn":2,"phone":2,"backwards":2,"hear":1,"low":1,"review":1,"prices":1,"iris":1,"with":4,"than":1,"had":16,"fly":2,"also":1,"made":1,"lifetime":1,"room":1,"heard":1,"this":9,"gotten":1,"straight":3,"second":1,"us":2,"until":1,"n't":12,"record":1,"standing":1,"anywhere":1,"can":2,"how":1,"were":4,"report":3,"about":1,"crackers":1,"more":1,"1-":1,"trips":1,"recheck":1,"something":1,"and":31,"real":2,"standby":5,"supervisor":5,"security":3,"up":2,"minutes":2,"is":9,"in":12,"it":5,"an":1,"somebody":1,"juice":1,"inn":1,"his":1,"experience":2,"not..":1,"home":1,"seen":1,"seem":1,"apparently":1,"id":1,"absolute":1,"huge":1,"confirmed":1,"issue":1,"want":2,"no":7,"check":2,"47":1,"that":28,"when":2,"any":2,"member":1,"far":2,"other":1,"5":2,"airlines":3,"which":8,"gate":3,"advise":1,"many":1,"stand":3,"closer":1,"trip":1,"repeat":1,"multiple":1,"bags":1,"class":1,"after":2,"problems":1,"me":5,"stay":1,"1-800":1,"two":2,"away":1,"coming":1,"'m":1,"aware":1,"extremely":5,"why":2,"'s":2,"72":1,"a":18,"michelle":3,"booked":1,"off":1,"treats":1,"database":1,"i":44,"international":1,"sit":1,"life":1,"walked":1,"think":1,"person":1,"definitely":1,"so":6,"came":1,"searched":1,"at":3,"position":1,"801":2,"thats":1,"corporate":1,"having":1,"talk":1,"charged":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

I could seriously write an entire book on my experience but I'll stick to the hellish facts.\n\nI bought a plane ticket for my friend for this weekend and what do you know she caught strep throat and could not fly, so I inquired about the alternatives on their website. I couldn't log into my account, so I called, asked if I could cancel and fly another date and I was told cancellation fee was $158.98\n\nSo I called back a second time to ask if I could at least change the name on the ticket and they said only if I had done it 7 days ago... please tell me how does that help me if someone gets sick the day before their flight?\n\nIn a nutshell they didn't give me any other choice but to cancel the flight and gave me a credit $32.80, so basically I paid them to NOT fly. I gave them a gift!\n\nI firmly believe this is thievery because money should be taken from customers when services are rendered.

She was trying to pile everything up to be weighed and someone in the line stepped out to help her.  Then when she was done they weighed it and they told her that the conveyor belt was broken and she had to deliver everything to a separate area.

This is probably as ghetto as an airline can get. Yes, it lists the cheapest flight prices on the internet, but they'll get you on: seat assignments, (+$5 to $25), printing your boarding pass at the counter (+$5), baggage fees (+$25), and if your carry on luggage has wheels (+$25). I'm thinking that this is their business model - charge the lowest fares, but don't tell the customer about the additional MANDATORY CHARGES, until they commit to the fare. This is EXTREMELY SHADY!!! I have a feeling that that this airline will not last long. If they told you about all these charges up front, then guess what? It's no longer the cheapest fare on the internet! \n\nThey pretty much ruined my vacation plans last week. I had a 4-day weekend and decided to go to the SF Bay Area. Flight was scheduled for 11:00am. When I got to the airport, they announced that the flight would be delayed for 5 HOURS!!! What the @%$#??? So now I end up missing a couple of important events. When we finally boarded the plane, it looked like they manage to jam a few more rows of seats into the plane, (it looks like they removed at least 6\" of legroom from each row). I felt sorry for the young lady sitting next to me - she was almost 6 feet tall and couldn't even straighten her legs. Heck, i'm only 5'8 and the legroom was too cramped for me!\n\nI think I heard an announcement that they don't use cleaning crews for the plane, and this is how they pass the [false] savings on to you. Right. The plane was filthy and disgusting. Bring your own hand sanitizer, as you don't know what kind of exotic bacterias you can pick up as a result of touching something in the cabin (think flesh-eating bacteria). If the interior of the plane is this bad, I shudder to think how well the engines and safety mechanisms are maintained. It's only a matter of time...\n\nOk, so Sunday rolls around and it's time for me to fly back home. I rush to the airport to make my 1:15pm flight. I get there and what's this? The flight is delayed 3 HOURS!!! ARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHH!!!! This is unreal - are these people not concerned with their reputation? What kind of amateurs are running this airline? It is probably a short-term venture capital operation. My prediction: they won't be around in a couple of years, or will be bought out by another airline. \n\nBottom line - save your money and your frustrations. Book any other airline but Spirit. Thousands of dissatisfied Spirit Airlines customers can't be wrong.\n\np.s. I have a feeling that most of the good reviews posted for Spirit Airlines are shills.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-03-26","useful":4,"counts":{"all":1,"0":1,"money":1,"out":1,"young":1,"years":1,"bring":1,"beat-up":1,"already":1,"looks":1,"seats":1,"go":1,"yes":1,"row":1,"25":3,"generous":1,"but":3,"$":6,"thinking":1,"(":6,"concerned":1,"had":1,"disgusting":1,"spirit":5,"shudder":1,"to":12,"charge":1,"jam":1,"dissatisfied":1,"11:00am":1,"pretty":1,"riding":2,"fares":1,"has":1,"thousands":1,"ca":2,"scheduled":1,"do":3,"them":1,"someone":1,"around":2,"get":3,"couple":2,"internet":2,"kind":2,"heard":1,"touching":1,"know":1,"they":10,"probably":2,"not":2,"now":1,"lady":1,"is":9,"ghetto":1,"like":3,"n't":7,"extremely":1,"airlines":2,"bay":1,"4-day":1,"assignments":1,"bad":1,"?":7,"each":1,"told":1,"boarded":1,"fare":2,"right":1,"old":1,"bacterias":1,"people":1,"frustrations":1,"back":1,"seat":1,"rate":1,"decided":1,"result":1,"pass":2,"home":1,"operation":1,"air":2,"bacteria":1,"short-term":1,"even":1,"reviews":1,"what":5,"said":1,"straighten":1,"for":8,"bottom":1,"wow":1,"since":1,"your":5,"3":1,"printing":1,"safety":1,"capital":1,"it":8,"got":1,"announced":1,"bought":1,"be":5,"we":1,"business":1,"announcement":1,"wo":1,"greyhound":1,"shills":1,"mechanisms":1,"guess":1,"hours":2,"[":1,"by":1,"on":6,"about":2,"last":2,"would":1,"luggage":1,"of":11,"could":1,"running":1,"flesh-eating":1,"airport":2,"heck":1,"airline":5,"pick":1,"1:15pm":1,"commit":1,"wheels":1,"star":1,"think":3,"missing":1,"exotic":1,"own":1,"legs":1,"into":1,"manage":1,"+":4,",":20,"feet":1,"maintained":1,"long":1,"another":1,"fees":1,"carry":1,"mandatory":1,".":26,"rolls":1,"cramped":1,"use":1,"rows":1,"from":1,"additional":1,"her":1,"area":1,"weekend":1,"there":1,"]":1,"finally":1,"least":1,"next":1,"-":5,"few":1,"much":1,"tell":1,"stars":1,"6":2,":":2,"was":4,"until":1,"cabin":1,"more":1,"lowest":1,"``":1,"only":2,"flight":5,"that":6,"with":1,"bus":1,"crews":1,"delayed":2,"lists":1,"prediction":1,"5'8":1,"too":1,"...":1,"@":1,"prices":1,"ok":1,"line":1,"removed":1,"customer":1,"sorry":1,"posted":1,"me":3,"boarding":1,"rush":1,"save":1,"cheapest":2,"this":9,"i":15,"up":3,"ruined":1,"will":2,"matter":1,"unreal":1,"can":2,"venture":1,"feeling":2,"my":3,"are":4,"and":11,"false":1,"then":1,"almost":1,"p.s":1,"sanitizer":1,"customers":1,"an":3,"''":2,"fly":1,"as":4,"good":1,"something":1,"have":2,"in":2,"legroom":2,"their":2,"she":1,"!":15,"these":2,"engines":1,"end":1,"no":1,")":6,"make":1,"sitting":1,"when":2,"amateurs":1,"any":1,"1":1,"how":2,"sunday":1,"other":1,"5":3,"vacation":1,"front":1,"interior":1,"you":5,"if":3,"events":1,"week":1,"'s":4,"plans":1,"book":1,"felt":1,"#":1,"hand":1,"most":1,"wrong":1,"plane":5,"cleaning":1,"'ll":2,"'m":2,"filthy":1,"model":1,"a":9,"give":1,"longer":1,"charges":2,"shady":1,"counter":1,"well":1,"important":1,"or":1,"looked":1,"baggage":1,"savings":1,"reputation":1,"so":2,"time":2,"at":2,"tall":1,"the":27,"%":1,"sf":1,"arrrrrrrrrggggggghhhh":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

Airlines is the best airline I've ever flown! I wish I could give it 10 stars! I'm not stupid, I'm not insane, I just know how to travel cheap, from point A to point B, and save a whole lot of money. I originally began flying Spirit in late 2011 from OAK-LAS and back several times a year. Ever since I began flying Spirit, I've had wonderful flights, all on time, never delayed or cancelled, I've had the kindest crew, and great comfort. \n\nDO NOT be fooled by other reviews where people say \"Don't fly Spirit; hidden fees\" where those users have only taken the airline once or twice, and have never read the fine print about what this airline does for it's customers. This airline does charge for both carry on and checked baggage, however Spirit allows you to put 1 small bag underneath the seat in front of you for free. Also, DO NOT try and sneak your bags through security thinking you'll get it on for free, they will charge you $100 at the gate-I've seen it, and I've seen people get rejected from boarding the flight because they didn't have $100 to pay the fee. Save yourself time and money by booking ahead of time. If you're smart, you may be in the $9 fare club like myself and gain instant access to discount bag fees and discount flights. It's one of the reasons I love this airline and why I fly so cheap. The most I ever paid for a roundtrip flight was $120 from Oakland to Las Vegas two days before the departure date. I didn't have any bags, I didn't select my seats, therefore, I paid the fare that I saw at the bottom. There are no hidden fees unless you're stupid to believe that being charged for baggage is a hidden fee. Also, they do charge for snacks (they give unlimited free refills for coffee and tea)-if you have a problem with that, fly for another airline. Spirit is meant to be a budget airline, and be thankful for flying!\n\nThroughout 2012, and just in 2013, I've been taking Spirit back and forth between Las Vegas and Oakland. Spirit has provided the cheapest fares with at least $100 in savings compared to different airlines, or airports. My flights, which are sometimes purchased at the last minute, end up costing me anywhere from $27-$60. My most recent flight cost me $27 and was purchased 30 hours before my flight left. Be sure to keep an eye out for their fares as they sometimes rise or lower as the days go on. If you're traveling without bags, and you're not selecting your seat, THE PRICE YOU SEE IS THE PRICE YOU PAY. Once you're at the airport, you can choose any seats free of charge, unless it's a Big Front Seat-then you'll have to pay a fee. The BFS are EXACTLY like business class of any other airline-It's like American, Delta or Airtran for Example. It's a 2x2 seat configuration with a little more recline than economy, and more legroom. Trust me. I tend to book BFS because I'm over 6 feet, and like to spread out like everyone else. The seats are HEAVENLY! Especially the brand new airbuses that just came out with leather seats! Even the cramped up seats towards the back are nice-you just have to spend a few minutes adjusting and you'll be fine.\n\nSpirit is a wonderful airline. I love flying with them, and always look at their fares before looking at other airlines. The crew is always a delight to be around, the flights always leave on time and tend to arrive a bit early. Despite their rules about charging for bags, or snacks, they're a great airline. Even Virgin Australia and Virgin America charges for snacks and checked baggage, so why complain?

Their agents and supervisors are rude and inconsiderate. \n\nSo on my way to Las Vegas, I left from LAX Airport in which I flew with a personal carry on item and was not stopped to pay for the bag however, as I left Las Vegas McCarran Airport, I was stopped by a Spirit Supervisor named DEBBIE and told to pay $100 for the SAME personal carry on item! After voicing the inconsistency of both airports, she stated I still had to pay for the item and that she could charge me double since I didn't pay the first time???? Now, I have worked in the field of customer service and the way she handled the situation was irrational. She had a snobby and careless attitude as I tried expressing that I was never told to pay for the luggage on my way to Vegas so I didn't understand why I was being charged now all of a sudden. Anyway, I had to pay $100 just to put my same item I flew to Vegas with on the same airline. Spirit Airlines should work on enforcing their policies at ALL airline check in points and at ALL Airline locations if they intend on making people pay for personal items as carry ons. I would have understood the protocol if I had to pay for my bag initially at LAX but to be inconvenienced after The fact makes no sense! My bag fit well under the seat when I flew to Vegas and I'm sure it would have fit just fine under the seat back to LA. This airline should also give their airline reps and Especially Supervisors proper training on customer service etiquette as well. Snapping at a customer because they don't understand policies and request understanding should not be the appropriate way to carry out their duty.  With this being said and experienced, I WILL NEVER FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE AGAIN.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2016-09-13","useful":4,"counts":{"etiquette":1,"all":3,"protocol":1,"just":2,"being":2,"anyway":1,"attitude":1,"still":1,"fine":1,"$":2,"fit":2,"la":1,"personal":3,"had":4,",":7,"should":3,"to":14,"charge":1,"under":2,"has":1,"do":1,"voicing":1,"reps":1,"flew":3,"me":1,"supervisors":2,"vegas":5,"worst":1,"they":2,"not":2,"now":2,"well":2,"airports":1,"did":2,"irrational":1,"bag":3,"careless":1,"she":4,"because":1,"people":1,"back":1,"seat":2,"understood":1,"sure":1,"are":1,"proper":1,"out":1,"n't":3,"said":1,"for":6,"item":4,"since":1,"expressing":1,"inconvenienced":1,"stopped":2,"ever":1,"?":4,"told":2,"be":2,"initially":1,"enforcing":1,"never":2,"however":1,"understanding":1,"situation":1,"put":1,"100":2,"by":1,"both":1,"training":1,"would":2,"luggage":1,"of":3,"could":1,"airport":2,"mccarran":1,"makes":1,"snobby":1,"first":1,"duty":1,"named":1,"appropriate":1,"agents":1,"carry":4,"ons":1,"from":1,"handled":1,"service":3,"stated":1,"airlines":1,".":10,"their":4,"debbie":1,"way":4,"was":5,"field":1,"that":2,"but":1,"locations":1,"understand":2,"worked":1,"inconsiderate":1,"with":4,"spirit":3,"customer":4,"this":3,"double":1,"work":1,"will":1,"policies":2,"items":1,"making":1,"my":5,"and":12,"supervisor":1,"give":1,"request":1,"in":3,"it":1,"fly":1,"as":4,"sudden":1,"at":4,"have":3,"sense":1,"check":1,"if":2,"!":2,"again":1,"no":1,"pay":8,"when":1,"same":3,"also":1,"which":1,"airline":7,"experienced":1,"intend":1,"tried":1,"rude":1,"after":2,"lax":2,"'m":1,"on":8,"why":1,"inconsistency":1,"las":2,"a":5,"especially":1,"i":18,"snapping":1,"points":1,"so":2,"time":1,"the":16,"left":2,"fact":1,"charged":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

Spirit Airlines is what it is. It is a cheap airline to fly with, however, every other little thing costs - carry-ons, checked baggage, picking a seat ahead of time, etc. The flights have always gotten me where I was going without too much delay. They are good about giving credits when credit is due. Where they can improve is customer service. My last trip to Detroit a couple months ago, I was running a bit behind. The agent at the desk was fairly quick getting me checked in and taking my luggage, but she wasn't exactly friendly. She huffed and puffed throughout the entire process, scolded me for being late, rolled her eyes at me, and when she called the gate to let them know there'd be two late passengers, she made sure to throw in some passive-aggressive insults as if I weren't standing right there.Then, she took our luggage and told us \"your baggage might make it to Detroit, it might not. It is your responsibility to come back here to pick it up if it doesn't.\" Then, when I started to ask her how we could ensure that we get our luggage (being that we were going to be in Detroit for several days and needed our clothing), she interrupted me and told me to hurry and leave. \n\nI didn't appreciate attitude.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2015-07-16","useful":2,"counts":{"being":2,"when":3,"cheap":1,"customer":1,"attitude":1,"(":1,",":15,"late":2,"to":10,"flights":1,"going":2,"might":2,"friendly":1,"fly":1,"them":1,"good":1,"get":1,"couple":1,"credit":1,"every":1,"know":1,"they":2,"desk":1,"not":1,"bit":1,"entire":1,"did":1,"always":1,"detroit":3,"leave":1,"she":6,"quick":1,"scolded":1,"where":2,"carry-ons":1,"right":1,"some":1,"back":1,"seat":1,"are":1,"our":3,"what":1,"for":3,"giving":2,"review":1,"behind":1,"does":1,"told":2,"be":2,"we":3,"rolled":1,"however":1,"here":1,"credits":1,"let":1,"ask":1,"picking":1,"come":1,"throw":1,"improve":1,"passengers":1,"about":1,"last":1,"service":1,"ahead":1,"luggage":3,"of":1,"taking":1,"months":1,"days":1,"called":1,"etc":1,"ensure":1,"airline":1,"pick":1,"huffed":1,"there":1,"reasons":1,"due":1,"puffed":1,"throughout":1,"your":2,"standing":1,"little":1,"checked":2,"her":2,"there.then":1,"airlines":1,".":12,"needed":1,"much":1,"too":1,"passive-aggressive":1,"was":4,"ago":1,"``":1,"that":2,"started":1,"exactly":1,"took":1,"but":1,"it":7,"hurry":1,"with":1,"spirit":2,"me":6,"made":1,"gotten":1,"getting":1,"up":1,"us":1,"n't":4,"can":1,"were":2,"my":2,"could":1,"and":7,"then":1,"process":1,"is":6,"am":1,"eyes":1,"agent":1,"an":1,"''":1,"as":1,"at":2,"have":1,"in":3,"clothing":1,"trip":1,"if":2,"thing":1,")":1,"make":1,"-":1,"delay":1,"how":1,"other":1,"gate":1,"several":2,"fairly":1,"sure":1,"insults":1,"running":1,"'d":1,"two":1,"a":4,"i":6,"average":1,"appreciate":1,"interrupted":1,"without":1,"baggage":2,"costs":1,"responsibility":1,"time":1,"the":5},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

Really cheap rates, but you get what you pay for.  Besides the usual complaints about endless hidden fees, no leg room, and no complimentary food or drink, they also are consistently late or cancelled.  My flight from Las Vegas to Oakland was delayed 4 hours.  We didn't leave until after 1 am!  After speaking with airport staff, they warned me that this is a regular occurrence and that Spirit airlines is always late or outright cancelled.  The TSA staff told me it's normal for airport police to mediate disputes between irate passengers and Spirit employees because their reliability and service is so poor.\n\nIt's one thing to be a bargain airline.  I think they take it too far with their exorbitant carry on luggage fees, but that's their prerogative.  It's another matter when you can't even get your passengers to their destination on time.

He did an excellent job explaining each and every additional charge and broke everything down right down to the amount they charge for fuel (pretty much all airlines charge for fuel, you just didn't know that). My last question before committing. \n\n\"hey, leg room is essential can we book aisle seats?\"\n\nUnfortunately all the aisles were already taken, but the agent then told us for an additional $75 we could book what they call the \"Big Seat\".\n\nWhat the hay, we want to get home and even though the flight would take us to Oakland and not SFO it was worth the risk and maybe might even score a Yelp review out of it.\n\nI must say, I was pleasantly surprised by said \"Big Seat\".

The service in the air was again good but not great then again it was only an hour plus flight.

One delay was a 4 hour delay! It was already a red eye and a flight going to Ft Lauderdale at 1am was on time, while we had to continue waiting for 1 hour. Departure time is more like boarding time (actually it's earlier). Took almost 1 hour to receive our baggage. Constant apologize, terrible customer service. Leg room was claustrophobic. I do not think the seat space could get any smaller! But if it could, your airline would probably find a way. Seats do not recline! No wifi, no TV's or movies on a 5-6 hour flight. We have to pay for water! Really? I cannot stand this airline and am so regretful that I went against what everyone else in my life and online had negatively said about Spirit airlines and booked my flight to Vegas anyways.

This airline should be ashamed of themselves and hopefully will either develop better compassion for the public or just call it a day and leave the airline industry altogether.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2014-07-18","useful":0,"counts":{"all":1,"just":1,"customer":2,"through":1,"seats":2,"find":1,"delay":2,"tv":1,"(":1,"delays":1,"had":2,",":6,"should":1,"better":1,"to":8,"flights":1,"going":1,"4":1,"factor":1,"?":3,"do":3,"them":2,"get":1,"compassion":1,"vegas":1,"altogether":1,"not":4,"day":1,"matched":1,"like":2,"leave":1,"continue":1,"-1":1,"either":2,"1am":1,"went":1,"smaller":1,"ft":1,"seat":1,"anyways":1,"choosing":1,"star":2,"really":2,"what":1,"said":1,"for":3,"space":1,"ways":1,"review":1,"waiting":1,"hopefully":1,"probably":1,"claustrophobic":1,"public":1,"red":1,"be":3,"we":2,"recline":1,"leg":1,"never":1,"regretful":1,"water":1,"reason":1,"put":1,"after":1,"care":1,"on":2,"about":2,"service":1,"luggage":1,"receive":1,"of":2,"could":2,"terrible":1,"against":1,"airline":4,"think":1,"already":1,"family":1,"one":1,"everyone":1,"apologize":1,"actually":1,"your":2,"given":1,"eye":1,"would":1,"give":1,"airlines":1,".":12,"much":1,"call":1,"too":1,"way":1,"themselves":1,"was":4,"more":2,"life":1,"flight":4,"both":1,"apparent":1,"took":1,"but":1,"else":1,"because":1,"lauderdale":1,"ashamed":1,"prices":1,"with":1,"spirit":1,"boarding":1,"room":1,"hour":4,"this":3,"will":3,"movies":1,"while":1,"can":1,"negatively":1,"my":3,"industry":1,"and":9,"constant":1,"...":1,"almost":1,"is":1,"am":1,"it":4,"at":1,"have":2,"in":2,"any":1,"if":1,"!":4,"develop":1,"no":3,")":1,"pay":1,"that":1,"1":3,"other":1,"online":1,"you":1,"stand":1,"repeat":1,"'s":2,"our":1,"price":1,"earlier":1,"friends":1,"why":1,"a":8,"booked":1,"5-6":1,"i":5,"wifi":1,"departure":1,"or":2,"baggage":1,"so":1,"allow":1,"time":3,"the":4},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

First off let me say I am not someone who is unfamiliar with the airline industry. I spent 20 years working in the travel industry and nearly half of that working for one of the largest airlines in the world. \n\nI cannot speak for their other station operations but I will tell you that their Fort Lauderdale operation is one of the most backwards (insert expletive here) operations I have ever seen. You walk in and they have a huge blue sign for self check in which states \"carry on bags only\". Another line with a large red sign stated \"full service check in\". After spending a half an hour in that line we were told we needed to be in the self service line because this line was for \"international only\". I explained that I could plainly see the signs above the agents said international but all of the others said \"self check in\". Didn't matter, we were rerouted to stand in the self check in line, in spite of the fact that we had checked bags. Because apparently I was supposed to psychically know that even though the sign said \"carry on only\" they would also check our bags. After making our way through what could loosely be referred to as a mob my husband and I finally checked in and paid our $166.00 for baggage (insert several other expletives here) only to to be sent to another line to hand off our bags. Well the other line turned out to be another check in line. I am not unaccustomed to lines, even confusing ones that evolve due to large groups of people but these were not lines. They were swirling confused masses of people with little or no direction.\n\nI didn't find my plane in particular to be unclean or the flight staff to be rude but after looking over the charges for everything (water, soda...) I began to wonder if the sick bag I had taken and used for my used kleenex (sue me I have a cold) wouldn't end up being an extra charge as well.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2011-11-15","useful":1,"counts":{"operations":2,"all":1,"being":1,"over":1,"years":1,"through":1,"signs":1,"cold":1,"find":1,"staff":1,"20":1,"$":1,"spite":1,"(":4,"masses":1,"had":2,",":4,"to":15,"finally":1,"other":3,"sent":1,"...":1,"them":1,"someone":1,"which":1,"flew":1,"self":4,"vegas":1,"nearly":1,"they":3,"half":2,"not":4,"world":1,"walk":1,"insert":2,"several":1,"did":2,"loosely":1,"large":2,"bag":1,"swirling":1,"husband":1,"referred":1,"because":3,"another":3,"people":2,"sign":3,"see":1,"our":4,"operation":1,"out":1,"blue":1,"will":1,"what":1,"said":3,"for":7,"looking":1,"everything":1,"above":1,"international":2,"speak":1,"ever":1,"red":1,"told":1,"be":6,"we":4,"full":1,"chose":1,"even":2,"here":2,"kleenex":1,"water":1,"let":1,"groups":1,"others":1,"from":1,"on":2,"backwards":1,"working":2,"mob":1,"of":8,"industry":2,"166.00":1,"airline":1,"soda":1,"or":2,"first":1,"this":1,"plainly":1,"extra":1,"expletive":1,"one":2,"agents":1,"primarily":1,"carry":2,"unclean":1,"little":1,"charge":1,"checked":2,"i":15,"service":2,"their":3,"spending":1,"only":4,".":15,"needed":1,"rerouted":1,"station":1,"way":1,"taken":1,"huge":1,"was":2,"tell":1,"direction":1,"flight":1,"that":7,"am":2,"but":4,"confused":1,"psychically":1,"lauderdale":2,"particular":1,"explained":1,"line":8,"with":3,"spirit":1,"fort":2,"me":2,"''":5,"hour":1,"these":1,"say":1,"n't":3,"matter":1,"can":1,"were":4,"making":1,"my":3,"could":2,"and":6,"due":1,"would":2,"stated":1,"supposed":1,"well":2,"is":2,"turned":1,"``":5,"an":2,"states":1,"as":2,"have":3,"in":14,"seen":1,"apparently":1,"check":6,"if":1,"bags":4,"end":1,"no":1,")":4,"began":1,"who":1,"also":1,"unaccustomed":1,"airlines":1,"sick":1,"largest":1,"you":2,"wonder":1,"stand":1,"fare":1,"evolve":1,"used":2,"rude":1,"though":1,"after":3,"sue":1,"paid":1,"hand":1,"most":1,"plane":1,"unfamiliar":1,"confusing":1,"las":1,"a":5,"off":2,"charges":1,"up":1,"lines":2,"spent":1,"know":1,"baggage":1,"ones":1,"the":16,"travel":1,"fact":1,"expletives":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

After my first flight the crappy service, lack of urgency, hours delayed, extremely dirty plane, and unprofessional staff I was ready to spend an extra 400$ to book a ticket back on a different airline just so I didn't have to do the return flight. I decided to give it one more chance and now here I am delayed for 2 hours so far (edit: TURNED OUT TO BE A 4 HOUR DELAY) kicking myself for thinking this company would actually do what it's supposed to do correctly.  I will NEVER fly this airline again. I wish I could create a pop-up window on their website that warns people not to put them through this hell. By the time I got on the plane for my first flight after experiencing such awful service\/dirty interior, I was so scared that the quality of the plane and pilots would match the quality of service.

 family and I were scheduled to fly from Las Vegas, NV to New Orleans, LA on 12\/29\/15 at 7:50 pm. The flight was delayed until 11:04 pm, we checked in our bags and got our boarding passes at around 6:45 pm and patiently waited at the gate for hours. At around 10:00 pm the announcer stated if we had carry-on luggage we should be in \"zone 1,\" if zone 1 wasn't indicated on our boarding passes we must come see her. I was in zone 4, I proceeded to her and she told me I had to pay $100, but the plane was coming in late from Denver, CO and I had plenty of time to go downstairs and pay for it at the counter. She (Evelyn) called downstairs and spoke with Maria to whom I was asked to see to pay for luggage. I asked her again if I had enough time to not miss my flight and she reassured me I had plenty of time. I then ran to see Maria, paid for my carry-on luggage and ran back to the gate. This all took approximately 30 minutes, as I am running back to the gate I hear my family's names being called as a \"last boarding call,\" and the doors would be closed after this last call. My husband and brother were already in line along with a second family, I can see them as I am running to the gate. As I arrive there I see the family arguing with the girl at the gate, but I wasn't paying much attention, then she indicated \"you guys are all too late.\" My husband proceeded to tell me that she shut the door closed as she was calling our names because they were all waiting in line as she was calling our names. A second girl with whom I had had an encounter with when we first came to the gate was standing next to this \"new\" girl who was telling us we were late, and I looked at her and said, \"you know we have been here since 7:00 pm waiting, you helped me with my minor brother's boarding pass and seat assignment,\" she just looked down at the floor and said nothing. The next girl stated we should talk to her manager who was standing at the next gate over. Unfortunately, I didn't catch her name, but this lady was extremely unprofessional to say the least. She said we should have been there on time as I explained what had happened and mentioned that her employee, Evelyn, indicated me to go downstairs and pay for luggage there and she ensured me I had plenty of time to do it. She then proceeded to do \"this thing\" with her head and said, in a very disturbing tone, \"well, you were at least one or two minutes late,\" and I told her my family and I were there since 6:45 pm when we checked in and to check on her computer that I was not lying to her. Long story short, they denied us boarding the aircraft, took my checked bag (which they declined to ship back to me), offered us to fly out 48 hrs later (which meant we'd spend New Year's in the air, just to fly back two days later). I was completely devastated, my 11 year old brother was in tears and my poor father who drove 4 hours from Pensacola, FL to meet us in New Orleans, LA was heartbroken. Spirit Airlines has refused to compensate us for their mistakes even though I called their customer service center and spoke with \"Pej\" who indicated this was not my fault, but they still would not reimburse me whatsoever. This has never happened to me and I feel just so defeated and devastated by it. I would never recommend flying on Spirit Airlines to anyone.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2016-01-05","useful":0,"counts":{"all":3,"least":2,"just":3,"from":3,"being":1,"over":1,"minutes":2,"7:50":1,"telling":1,"manager":1,"mistakes":1,"go":2,"co":1,"still":1,"guys":1,"orleans":2,"$":1,"zone":3,"la":2,"(":3,"again":1,"had":9,",":33,"hrs":1,"should":3,"late":4,"to":31,"tears":1,"compensate":1,"4":2,"whatsoever":1,"employee":1,"tell":1,"has":2,"happened":2,"scheduled":1,"customer":1,"them":1,"around":2,"very":1,"devastated":2,"vegas":1,"know":1,"they":4,"new":4,"not":4,"lady":1,"encounter":1,"counter":1,"reassured":1,"stated":2,"name":1,"did":1,"plane":1,"''":8,"brother":3,"calling":2,"bag":1,"she":11,"husband":2,"names":3,"because":1,"old":1,"back":4,"seat":1,"mentioned":1,"see":5,"computer":1,"doors":1,"are":1,"pass":1,"our":5,"girl":4,"declined":1,"out":1,"even":1,"what":1,"said":4,"for":6,"announcer":1,"since":2,"paying":1,"waiting":2,"pej":1,"denied":1,"got":1,"told":2,"be":2,"we":11,"never":2,"do":2,"unprofessional":1,"attention":1,"here":1,"refused":1,"hours":2,"completely":1,"checked":3,"100":1,"come":1,"by":1,"after":1,"on":5,"arrive":1,"last":2,"carry-on":2,"luggage":4,"fault":1,"30":1,"aircraft":1,"thing":1,"her":11,"heartbroken":1,"12\/29\/15":1,"asked":2,"waited":1,"first":1,"already":1,"tone":1,"family":5,"feel":1,"father":1,"explained":1,"one":1,"down":1,"denver":1,"approximately":1,"drove":1,"miss":1,"along":1,"patiently":1,"standing":2,"passes":2,"story":1,"long":1,"proceeded":3,"spoke":2,"service":1,"whom":2,"extremely":1,"there":4,"two":2,"been":2,"next":3,"anyone":1,"their":2,"pensacola":1,"much":1,"call":2,"too":1,"recommend":1,"las":1,"was":17,"until":1,"minor":1,"closed":2,"``":8,"flight":2,"6:45":2,"enough":1,"downstairs":3,"flying":1,"offered":1,"delayed":1,"but":4,"hear":1,"catch":1,"line":2,"an":1,"with":8,"spirit":2,"must":1,"me":9,"boarding":5,"were":6,"unfortunately":1,"this":7,"second":2,"10:00":1,"air":1,"n't":3,"can":1,"of":3,"meet":1,"pm":6,"my":12,"called":3,"and":26,"meant":1,"would":3,"indicated":4,"then":3,"ran":2,"evelyn":2,"year":2,"am":2,"it":3,"defeated":1,"days":1,"helped":1,"fly":3,"say":1,"at":10,"have":2,"disturbing":1,"shut":1,"door":1,"ship":1,"11:04":1,"as":7,"if":3,"bags":1,"us":5,"48":1,"floor":1,")":3,"pay":4,"that":3,"when":2,"check":1,"1":2,".":21,"7:00":1,"airlines":2,"which":2,"reimburse":1,"gate":7,"you":4,"nv":1,"poor":1,"'s":3,"time":5,"though":1,"arguing":1,"assignment":1,"who":4,"paid":1,"ensured":1,"running":2,"'d":1,"plenty":3,"coming":1,"nothing":1,"fl":1,"maria":2,"a":4,"short":1,"in":11,"center":1,"i":29,"came":1,"later":2,"well":1,"head":1,"or":1,"looked":2,"so":1,"talk":1,"took":2,"11":1,"the":20,"spend":1,"lying":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

am actually writing this review having gotten off the plane after travelling for 12 hours (when the flight should've been more than half that time) on my first and only encounter with Spirit Airlines. I totally regret not having read the reviews before booking my flight - cheap fares are definitely too good to be true with this airline.\n\nEmbarked on a flight from Las Vegas to La Guardia (NYC) airport, via stopover in Detroit.\n\nFound out a few hours before my flight departed that there was a charge for carry-on and check-in luggage - $100 at the gate if you don't buy it beforehand! Daylight robbery. So I paid $40 for my carry-on, but when I arrived at the airport asked if this could be refunded as my luggage fit inside the 'test' compartment at check-in. The service attendant basically waved me away and told me I'd have to pay as it was 'outside the dimensions'. Whatever. \n\nDeparture time was 8.12am. After arriving at the airport 2 hours before the flight departure time, and upon arrival at the gate we were told that the flight was potentially overbooked and that they were seeking volunteers to take a later flight. This was the first scare. However the flight ended up departing approximately on time. Too good to be true? Read on.\n\nArrived in Detroit for a 'brief' stopover. Original time of departure was meant to be 4pm. Passengers were told nothing and it was only until I checked the departure screen that there was now a 2 hour delay, scheduled for 6pm! Went back to the lounge and then was told that the flight would be departing at 5.15pm - no reason was given for the delay.\n\nAll passengers boarded for an anticipated 5.15pm departure. It was only when we were all seated and waiting in the tarmac that the captain decided to tell us that La Guardia airport was closed due to bad weather in NYC. Funny though, that a fellow passenger called out that her friend was departing on a Delta plane at the same time and on the same flight leg, yet her flight was not delayed? The attendant did not seem to know how to respond to this. She called the captain and the captain's best line was that the weather was bad and was causing delays everywhere. Not sure if this was true but after reading MANY negative reviews about Spirit on Yelp, it seems that this is not the first time they have acted dishonestly and used the weather as an excuse for their sloppy practices.\n\nTo top this off, we were then told we could not disembark the plane (since we didn't know if our flight would actually depart due to the so-called weather problems in NYC) and if we chose to do so, would not be able to re-board! The attendant also let us know that Spirit would not be giving out free snacks or water for the delay, and that they would have to 'seek permission from the company first.' What the hell!? This was now beyond a joke. In my entire experience of flying, I have never encountered such unprofessional level of service by an airline. I don't understand how this company is still in business! \n\nAfter waiting on the tarmac, we finally found out at 6.30pm we were able to fly.

I was thinking I probably made a mistake based on the negative reviews on Yelp.  \n\nI opted to check one bag and purchased seat assignments.  I arrived at the airport and was surprised to find 5 Spirit Airline employees working the check in counter.  They were very friendly and efficient, and the process went smoothly.  The rules were clear about the 40 pound weight limit, so I weighed the bag before I went to the airport.  The plane we were taking arrived from Chicago, and they loaded the plane very quickly.  We pulled away from the gate 10 minutes early, and were in the air before I scheduled departure time.  Upon arrival in Houston I only waited about 5 minutes for the bag to come out.  \n\nOn the return trip check in was a breeze.  This time the plane coming from Chicago was about 15 minutes late so we were about 15 minutes late departing.

This flights were smooth and the landings were very easy. For families who need to fly cheaper, this is a great way to go. I was not paid by Spirit or anything, just an honest opinion.

How do you run out of half the liquor you supposedly carry and you have only taken orders from front of plane to the exit row?\n-Delays for hours with no believable reasoning.\n-We were stuck on tarmac last night\/this morning coming back to LV from DFW for an hour plus and then could hardly get past two Spirit gates deplaning as aisles were full of passengers waiting for more delayed outbound flights. Oh, forgot to mention baggage took another half an hour during which time people were trying to figure out what carousel bags would come in on.  The baggage office attendant told one passenger well Spirit bags come out on 10, 11, 12, etc..providing no other help than the simple Spirit sign with an arrow at entrance to the one side of baggage claim.\n\nWhile I belong to their \"club\" which supposedly provides some value don't know how much I will use it as I will try to avoid flying this airline in the future.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-06-24","useful":2,"counts":{"uninterested":1,"gates":1,"help":1,"office":1,"money":1,"half":2,"facial":1,"front":2,"expressions":1,"reasoning":1,"previous":1,"supposedly":2,"night\/this":1,"how":3,",":11,"opportunities":1,"should":1,"lv":1,"to":10,"only":2,"weeks":1,"include":1,"thousands":1,"then":1,"questionable":1,"than":2,"get":2,"conversations":1,"couple":2,"am":1,"overall":1,"pocket":1,"mention":1,"know":1,"they":2,"schedules":1,"not":7,"during":1,"like":2,"bar":1,"helpful":2,"skills":1,"make":1,"morning":1,"ignore":1,"twice":1,"guiding":1,"employees":1,"side":1,"mean":1,"seating":1,"people":1,"liquor":2,"some":1,"back":1,"sign":1,"past":1,"are":4,"forgot":1,"standards":1,"out":3,"try":1,"what":2,"for":6,"inappropriate":1,"avoid":1,"tarmac":1,"everything":1,"waiting":1,"exit":1,"provides":1,"row":1,"across":1,"?":1,"told":1,"knowing":1,"be":1,"full":2,"run":1,"reasonable":1,"do":2,"little":1,"hours":1,"others":1,"losing":1,"attendant":1,"come":2,"by":1,"-they":1,"suggest":1,"passengers":3,"last":2,"service":1,"dress\/appearance":1,"of":8,"taking":1,"experience":1,"times":1,"etc":2,"magazine":1,"flown":1,"plus":1,"airline":3,"-we":1,"act":1,"pilots":1,"whole":1,"or":2,"appropriately":1,"-delays":1,"claim":1,"simple":1,"entrance":1,"marked":1,"one":2,"will":2,"another":1,"carry":1,"bench":1,"miss":1,"use":1,"charge":1,"from":2,"would":3,"few":1,"dfw":1,"flying":2,"airlines":1,".":16,"stuck":1,"much":1,"carousel":1,"taken":1,"hardly":1,"more":1,"attendants":1,"obese":1,"``":2,"flight":1,"that":1,"club":1,"bus":1,"delayed":1,"but":1,"photos":1,"adult":1,"particular":1,"trying":1,"with":3,"spirit":3,"stocking":1,"customer":1,"10":1,"12":1,"hour":2,"this":4,"oh":1,"value":2,"n't":1,"while":1,"future":1,"were":3,"my":1,"could":1,"examples":1,"and":4,"passenger":1,"flights":1,"figure":1,"...":3,"metal":1,"is":3,"thus":1,"it":1,"an":3,"''":2,"as":2,"experts":1,"against":1,"have":4,"in":5,"believable":1,"seem":1,"apparently":1,"their":2,"if":1,"bags":2,"different":1,"outbound":1,"deplaning":1,"no":3,"pay":1,"travel":1,"belong":1,"-":1,"any":1,"also":1,"-the":1,"other":2,"which":4,"you":6,"sure":1,"hires":1,"who":2,"took":1,"plane":2,"two":1,"coming":1,"aisles":1,"on":3,"a":3,"i":8,"makes":1,"average":1,"well":1,"arrow":1,"baggage":3,"cramped":1,"time":1,"11":1,"the":14,"at":1,"orders":1,"etc..providing":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

UGH. Never again. Ever. First, I'm a loyal Southwest customer. I've come to value, very highly, their policies and procedures, especially after my experience with Spirit. \n\nI flew out to Chicago for my cousin's graduation and ended up booked on Southwest to Chicago and on Spirit on the way home (my mom booked and paid for my flights). On the way there, everything was peachy keen. Landed at O'Hare, which Id heard horror stories about, but everything went supersmooth. \n\nOn the way back: Had to go through Midway this time, which was just sucky. Since the only way to check in online and print out one's boarding pass beforehand is to pay extra to pick a seat at the time of booking, I ended up in a short line to do all that at the airport. It took over 45 minutes for the 6 people ahead of me to get through the line. There were 4 agents working at the time. Frustrating, but I'm a very relaxed flier, so I wrote it off. Once I finally got through the line and through security, I had about 40 minutes until boarding. Once at the gate, I realized that there was no information re: flights anywhere. There were no gate agents to be seen, no monitors that could tell me that my flight was delayed, no nothing. I found out that I was delayed through word of mouth from all the other passengers. There were 2 gates in this area, with two flights scheduled. Everyone was confused about which gate they were leaving from, since the gates were written on our boarding passes by the agents at the front desk. I had to keep calling my family to get updates on my flight (no free wifi at Midway!). Eventually, two Spirit employees showed up, with no information. Eventually, boarding was started. It was easily the most chaotic boarding process I've ever seen. There was simply a crush of people trying to hand their boarding passes to the agent. No line, no attempt by the other Spirit employee to organize the crowd. I consider the fact that I got on the correct plane at all to be a minor miracle. \n\nDuring the flight, I was thirsty (the two hour delay, coupled with there being no restaurants\/stores in the Spirit terminal). However, I was not about to pay for a drink on the flight. Not even an adult beverage; they even charge for water! Ridiculous.\n\nPretty much: if you purchase a Spirit fare all excited that it's so cheap, it's not. Assuming that you want to carry anything more than a purse\/backpack to your destination, print a boarding pass the night before or have a beverage and a bag of peanuts while flying, you'll end up paying at least the difference between the Spirit fare and the next cheapest. It might appear to be a deal, until you get nickeled and dimed to death.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2012-06-05","useful":2,"counts":{"gates":2,"all":4,"ugh":2,"consider":1,"just":1,"being":1,"over":1,"cheap":1,"seen":2,"ended":2,"flier":1,"through":5,"purse\/backpack":1,"before":1,"difference":1,"everything":2,"(":3,"delayed":2,"had":3,",":28,"spirit":7,"terminal":1,"to":21,"finally":1,"4":1,"pretty":1,"employee":1,"peanuts":1,"might":1,"excited":1,"southwest":2,"scheduled":1,"eventually":2,"agents":3,"get":3,"very":2,"horror":1,"assuming":1,"flew":1,"updates":1,"mom":1,"desk":1,"front":1,"during":1,"highly":1,"procedures":1,"easily":1,"showed":1,"dimed":1,"miracle":1,"calling":1,"bag":1,"night":1,"found":1,"went":1,"wrote":1,"everyone":1,"sucky":1,"crowd":1,"people":2,"there":7,"back":1,"seat":1,"go":1,"pass":2,"home":1,"'ve":2,"monitors":1,"out":3,"even":2,"graduation":1,")":3,"appear":1,"for":5,"chicago":2,"since":2,"crush":1,"re":1,"written":1,"restaurants\/stores":1,"between":1,"print":2,"got":2,";":1,"ever":2,"correct":1,"booking":1,"be":3,"chaotic":1,"after":1,"do":1,"never":1,"however":1,"free":1,"water":1,"death":1,"cousin":1,"come":1,"by":2,"passengers":1,"about":4,"ahead":1,"of":5,"could":1,"experience":1,"leaving":1,"keen":1,"airport":1,"pick":1,"midway":2,"first":1,"booked":2,"organize":1,"family":1,"extra":1,"45":1,"one":1,"simply":1,"carry":1,".":33,"your":1,"passes":2,"charge":1,"from":2,"deal":1,"working":1,"area":1,"destination":1,"they":2,"o'hare":1,"least":1,"next":1,"their":2,"much":1,"way":4,"6":1,":":3,"was":11,"until":2,"minor":1,"more":1,"a":13,"only":1,"flight":4,"nickeled":1,"on":9,"started":1,"flying":1,"relaxed":1,"took":1,"but":2,"it":6,"landed":1,"ridiculous":1,"adult":1,"off":1,"line":4,"trying":1,"with":4,"than":1,"me":2,"boarding":7,"word":1,"anything":1,"hour":1,"cheapest":1,"this":2,"up":4,"value":1,"tell":1,"while":1,"anywhere":1,"stories":1,"policies":1,"were":5,"frustrating":1,"employees":1,"at":9,"and":9,"flights":3,"security":1,"thirsty":1,"coupled":1,"process":1,"minutes":2,"is":1,"beforehand":1,"confused":1,"agent":1,"an":1,"heard":1,"customer":1,"have":1,"in":4,"my":7,"keep":1,"id":1,"if":1,"!":2,"again":1,"'ll":1,"want":1,"no":9,"not":3,"pay":2,"that":8,"40":1,"check":1,"delay":1,"paying":1,"other":2,"which":3,"online":1,"gate":3,"you":4,"fare":2,"'s":4,"information":2,"our":1,"drink":1,"paid":1,"hand":1,"most":1,"plane":1,"mouth":1,"two":3,"peachy":1,"nothing":1,"end":1,"'m":2,"2":1,"purchase":1,"realized":1,"short":1,"attempt":1,"especially":1,"i":17,"wifi":1,"or":1,"supersmooth":1,"loyal":1,"beverage":2,"so":2,"time":3,"the":29,"fact":1,"once":2},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

Even if the plane is empty they pile up all people in full rows with half the plane empty. You can move but it just goes to show you how unorganized they are.\n3. The service is TERRIBLE. Our flight got delayed 3 hours and we did not get any voluntary updates during that time. After an hour sitting at the airport they let us on the plane. There after sitting there for half an hour we had to prod them several times for info. We were misled that we were waiting for the pilot to get off the plane to our left so it'd be a few minutes. Again waited for another 30 minutes and had to extract information from them and they would take their sweet time. They'd just stand in front and chat happily and laugh as if they didn't have over 100 eyes boring holes through their skulls. So then OH NO it's not the plane to the left, it's the plane to the right that just landed. Everyone was so angry and they did nothing to appease us. No water or snacks were offered either. Another 30 minutes and OH NO it's not that plane...it's one that hasn't even landed yet. WTF?!  So by the time the pilot showed and and we taxed it was 2:25 am already. on a 10:30 flight. Very unorganized. Which company thinks it's okay to make so many passengers sit on a plane without real information? People were so mad I wouldn't have doubted someone starting a shoot out. So glad to be back alive :(\n4. In case you didn't see it from other reviews they are supposed to be cheap but milk you for every penny.

I am a member of their BS $9 fair club (lol $9 ... where?) which is a colossal rip-off with a non-refundable, recurring membership charge of $59.95 annually. Seriously, complete rip-off. \n\nI try booking my flight to Las Vegas last night and kept getting payment errors on the website, after trying 5 times.  Hmm..verified with my bank and it's Spirit's payment processor.  I call their customer service line and am told by the agent that I'll be charged extra because I'm not using their website, which does not work!  The agent tells me there are no longer direct flights from SAN to LAS.  What?!  How is that possible when it's still on their website and all other third-party travel sites.  I kept complaining about, was put on-hold, and after the 4th time, the agent is ready to book my flight, to the same destination, same flight that I was tediously been trying to book for the last hour on the phone with them to be told I should try using a different browser, particularly IE (I tried Firefox and Chrome - I do not have or use IE).  They transfer me to the Spirit Club agent.  I have to give ALL of my information over again, explain the situation, explain that I am not going to pay the agent telephone booking fee; she tries to make the reservation for me, it cancels itself in their system!  90 mins wasted.  \n\nBare bones is right, but the \"cheap\" prices surely do not match the level of bullshit online at their website, their agents who are not trained properly, an automated phone system where you have to give all your information and then REPEAT to the agent (what is the point!??), print your own boarding pass, and tiny, tiny seats that do not recline. I am 5'7\" @ 130 lbs and I am touching shoulders and thighs with the person in the next seat.  The person behind me gave me an unsolicited and unappreciated acupressure session with their knees in my back the entire flight, due to the complete lack of space, highlighting the term 'cattle class'.  Just pack 'em in!    \n\nSo while the base fare is cheap, when you add everything else, its the same fare as you'd pay on any larger airline - BUT you have to deal with their paired-down customer service and tiny seats.  \n\nLike anything else in the world, the only people coming out large on this is the shareholders at the customers expense. \"Adjusted net income for the full year 2015 increased 33.6 percent to $316.2 million\".\n\nI have cancelled the BS membership and will never fly with them again. DON'T BE FOOLED!  We vote with our $$ .

Certainly not at the front to answer question. However an agent did come to the front a little after 9:30 pm and was so kind enough to offer all of us a $7.00 meal voucher. Now thats class spirit!!! Great way to keep people happy :).\n  At that time a supervisor was requested to come & answer some of our questions did anyone ever show? Of course not.

Ridiculous. \n\nDon't use Spirit. Pay the \"extra\" money to use another flight, and you'll break even with the additional fees Spirit tacks on.

Yes, the seats offer minimal leg room.  Yes, you pay for EVERYTHING.  However, look at the price you are paying to FLY to your destination vs what other airlines are charging.  I feel like the people complaining about paying for things have never left their home town.  You cannot honestly expect to pay $80 for an airline ticket and get all the same perks you would get if you were paying $300.  That's just ignorant, and no company would be able to make money that way.  \n\nThey charge you to have a representative print off your boarding pass at the airport because they have to pay that representative to be there.  They charge you for your carry-on because it's more weight which means the plane is using more fuel.  Same reason they charge you more than other airlines for checked bags.\n\nI do understand being upset about a delay, but that happens with any airline.  I've been delayed with United, Delta and American Airlines.  This was the first time I flew Spirit, and we did not experience a delay.\n\nThe pilots on both flights were wonderful, keeping us updated on local weather and landing times, and making corny jokes during those updates.  The flight attendants were also wonderful, keeping their composure when a large group of black men got too rowdy and were screaming profanities along with the N-word.  The flight attendants, although they were only two tiny women, let the men know that their behavior would not be tolerated and got them to calm down.\n\nBottom line, you should ALWAYS do your research before buying anything, and airline tickets are no exception.  Research before you book so you know what to expect and you will have no problems.  If you are someone who will let a couple hour delay ruin your whole weekend.. well, maybe you shouldn't fly then.  \n\nWould definitely fly Spirit again.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":4,"date":"2014-09-17","useful":2,"counts":{"things":1,"all":1,"just":1,"being":1,"money":1,"able":1,"seats":1,"yes":2,"before":2,"group":1,"$":2,"ruin":1,",":16,"should":2,"to":10,"charge":3,"other":2,"black":1,"those":1,"fuel":1,"local":1,"then":1,"updated":1,"someone":1,"get":2,"couple":1,"keeping":2,"flew":2,"vegas":1,"updates":1,"they":5,"got":2,"not":3,"during":1,"ticket":1,"screaming":1,"look":1,"tickets":1,"like":1,"did":1,"always":1,"'ve":1,"large":1,"jokes":1,"16th":1,"husband":1,"because":2,"weight":1,"people":1,"understand":1,"back":1,"offer":1,"expect":2,"pass":1,"home":1,"80":1,"happens":1,"will":2,"what":2,"for":5,"bottom":1,"paying":3,"research":2,"upset":1,"everything":1,"print":1,"n-word":1,"minimal":1,"be":3,"we":1,"never":1,"leg":1,"300":1,"men":2,"however":1,"reason":1,"let":2,"although":1,"from":1,"along":1,"on":4,"about":2,"carry-on":1,"anything":1,"of":1,"experience":1,"times":1,"perks":1,"airline":3,"pilots":1,"sept":1,"first":1,"destination":1,"feel":1,"airlines":4,"down":1,"weather":1,"been":1,"weekend..":1,"your":5,"checked":1,"composure":1,"profanities":1,"there":1,"two":1,"tiny":1,".":20,"spirit":3,"their":3,"wonderful":2,"calm":1,"way":1,"was":1,"too":1,"attendants":2,"tolerated":1,"only":1,"flight":2,"both":1,"company":1,"delayed":1,"but":1,"ignorant":1,"representative":2,"delta":1,"line":1,"with":3,"than":1,"buying":1,"women":1,"town":1,"boarding":1,"exception":1,"12":1,"room":1,"hour":1,"this":1,"us":1,"n't":1,"can":1,"behavior":1,"were":5,"making":1,"more":3,"my":1,"flights":1,"are":4,"and":12,"would":4,"have":4,"do":2,"rowdy":1,"is":1,"it":1,"minneapolis":1,"an":1,"fly":3,"vs":1,"at":2,"corny":1,"any":1,"if":2,"bags":1,"united":1,"no":3,"complaining":1,"pay":3,"make":1,"means":1,"when":1,"airport":1,"same":2,"delay":3,"also":1,"that":5,"book":1,"which":1,"honestly":1,"you":14,"charging":1,"'s":2,"again":1,"whole":1,"price":1,"who":1,"problems":1,"them":1,"plane":1,"landing":1,"a":5,"off":1,"using":1,"i":5,"maybe":1,"well":1,"definitely":1,"so":1,"time":1,"american":1,"the":13,"left":1,"know":2},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

You're going to need it because Spirit is going to give you a painful screwing whether you want it or not. \n\nWhile gleefully booking your low-cost reservation, what Spirit fails to disclose up front during the process is that they make up for their attractive rates by applying, quite deceitfully I would argue, scores of subsequent charges. \n\nCARRY-ON BAGS:  $35\/bag when checking in online; $100\/bag if checking in at airport.\n\nCHECKED BAGS: $30\/bag when checking in online; $100\/bag if checking in at airport.\n\nSEATS:  Want to sit next to your travel companion(s)? Pay $10 a person to have some control over seat selection. Failing to pay the ransom charge will result in Spirit randomly generating seat assignments for you and those in your party to sit in so that everyone is separated on the flight. \n\nThe charges don't stop there:\n\n* Cup of coffee on the plane?     $CHARGE$\n\n* Cup of water on the plane?     $CHARGE$\n\n* 2oz. pack of salted nuts?          $CHARGE$\n\nI didn't verify this, but I wouldn't be surprised if they charged you a fee for wanting to wipe your ass in the aircraft's lavatory. \n\nSpirit is so cheap that they don't even provide magazines to read in the individual seat pockets, unless you find mandatory FAA safety instructions entertaining. Oh, and speaking of seats, they offer little leg room. (See attached photo of my legs pressing into the back of the senior citizen sitting in front of me).\n\nSpirit is not timely. The concept of adhering to a flight schedule is apparently mystifying to its management. Our flight was over two hours delayed. When our airplane finally arrived and I thought we were going to promptly board, we were further delayed in the terminal because our pilot, apparently, couldn't quell a fierce cheesesteak yearning and felt compelled to make a run to the food court. Who cares that their tardiness had already affected hundreds of people across multiple cities; the most urgent item of business was inserting a cheeseteak into the hole in his face.\n\nAfter we did finally land at our destination and were disembarking the flying trash can we were stuck on, Spirit, in a mad rush to catch up with its schedule, began irresponsibly boarding the next flight before all of us passengers had even finished departing the plane!

You're ticked off because you didn't know that you had to pay extra for your bags, only to get to the airport and have to pay $50 or something for your carryon. Do you not read? Everything is laid out there for you. The reality is that they are cheap. Cheap. Cheap. If you plan on bringing 2 bags and a carryon with you, fly southwest. If you can get by with a personal item, or even one checked bag, you're getting ahead. Let me tell you about my recent experience. I flew from PHL to Myrtle Beach with my husband and son (lap infant). We paid $140 for two tickets and purchased one checked bag. We were able to bring the following (for FREE): a diaper bag, a personal item each, a stroller, and a car seat. The gate agents at both Philadelphia and Myrtle Beach were super sweet, even gave my son a sticker. On both flights, we got on the plane and were seated together and had an additional seat between us both ways (so my son had his own seat). And the flight attendants were hilarious. Great experience. I have flown with Spirit probably 10 times and each time I find a good experience. The people that don't are the ones that don't pay attention and pay all of the extra fees. That's your own fault. I am currently pricing flights to Vegas. I can buy a sale fare that works out to $50 roundtrip from PHL. $50 people. So what if I have to pay for a soda and a carryon.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":4,"date":"2014-10-16","useful":0,"counts":{"all":2,"cheap":3,"infant":1,"bring":1,"through":1,"find":2,"$":4,"personal":2,"(":3,"had":3,",":9,"to":9,"only":1,"travelers":1,"southwest":1,"do":3,"his":1,"get":2,"read":2,"ticked":1,"between":1,"flew":1,"ones":1,"know":1,"they":1,"got":1,"not":1,"one":3,"bringing":1,"is":2,"tickets":1,"--":1,"50":3,"item":2,"common":1,"each":2,"did":1,"works":1,"husband":1,"carryon":3,"because":1,"people":2,"seat":3,"pricing":1,"myrtle":2,"out":2,"even":2,"reviews":1,"what":1,"for":6,"bag":3,"ways":1,"currently":1,"everything":1,"laid":1,"hilarious":1,"probably":1,"?":1,"we":3,"attention":1,"free":1,"were":4,"let":1,"checked":2,"super":1,"by":1,"on":3,"about":1,"ahead":1,"getting":1,"of":1,"experience":3,"times":1,"airport":1,"plane":1,"soda":1,"or":2,"own":2,"extra":2,"sweet":1,"son":3,"agents":1,"fees":1,"your":3,"from":2,"additional":1,"there":1,"two":1,".":23,"2":1,":":1,"tell":1,"attendants":1,"buy":1,"flight":1,"both":3,"something":1,"great":1,"diaper":1,"with":4,"spirit":1,"me":1,"10":1,"these":1,"car":1,"seated":1,"n't":3,"i":8,"'re":2,"can":2,"fault":1,"following":1,"gave":1,"my":4,"are":2,"and":13,"flights":2,"have":3,"sticker":1,"am":1,"an":1,"fly":1,"good":1,"at":1,"purchased":1,"if":3,"bags":2,"us":1,")":3,"pay":5,"that":6,"able":1,"reality":1,"gate":1,"you":10,"beach":2,"fare":1,"'s":1,"philadelphia":1,"140":1,"phl":2,"denominator":1,"paid":1,"flown":1,"plan":1,"lap":1,"recent":1,"a":11,"off":1,"roundtrip":1,"sale":1,"together":1,"vegas":1,"so":2,"time":1,"uneducated":1,"the":9,"stroller":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

I had never heard of it but thought how bad can 1.5 hrs. be???? Well, I was REALLY WRONG!!!!\n\nFirst off: after receiving the confirmation, I went to the site and selected seats.  To pre-select seats, you have to pay anywhere from $5 to $13 or randomly get assigned seats.  Not a big deal--there are no pre-selected seats at the Southwest Airlines cattle call--I'll just check in early.  Then, I noticed that they charge for carry-on and for checked bags other than 1 \"personal item\" (usually a purse for women).  Not a big deal--there are workarounds.\n\nThe biggest thing that was BEYOND the PALE was we recently had a death in the family and the service coincided with the day of our return from our trip.  Asking to move the flight forward a few hours so we can attend the service, I was told, ABSOLUTELY, NO BEREAVEMENT, NO MEDICAL, NO REASON WHATSOEVER for a change, but we were welcome to pay $124\/person change fee and the difference in the cost of fares.  Luckily, there are also other options and my AP, the deceased sibling, WILL attend the service.\n\nTo top insult to injury, when we left, we were charged $5 for a wheelchair for my AP--normally, I would tip this amount for the service anyway, but this highway robbery definitely essentially guaranteed that the employee who hustled my AP in a wheelchair and dumped him off at the gate will not be tipped.  Then, there was the matter of the plane being 2.5 hrs. late for a 1.5 hr. flight--this on top of asking passengers to arrive at the airport 2 hrs. early.  Luckily for Spirit Airlines, I was still enjoying the wonderful lunch I had before I went to the airport.  The final \"oddity\" was the charge for beverages--$4, which is not a hardship for us as we had plenty of time to ingests lots of liquids in the 2.5 hr. delay and to refill our waterbottles.\n\n\nSo, to save a few bucks, is it worth dealing with being nickled and dimed to death, and to be treated like cargo rather than a human being (the handling of the bereavement\/medical emergencies, promoting passenger dehydration)--EMPHATICALLY NO!!!","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-08-29","useful":0,"counts":{"default":1,"just":1,"hustled":1,"when":1,"move":1,"anyway":1,"assigned":1,"dehydration":1,"human":1,"seats":4,"heard":1,"still":1,"before":1,"1":1,"death":2,"$":5,"how":1,"personal":1,"(":4,"had":4,",":24,"hrs":3,"day":1,"late":1,"to":15,"charge":2,"promoting":1,"4":1,"whatsoever":1,"employee":1,"fares":1,"enjoying":1,"worth":1,"southwest":1,"then":2,"confirmation":1,"return":1,"get":1,"big":2,"early":2,"lunch":1,"were":2,"they":1,"not":4,"world":1,"difference":1,"him":1,"like":1,"--":7,"item":1,"bad":1,"?":4,"robbery":1,"injury":1,"went":2,"after":1,"deal":2,"absolutely":1,"dealing":1,"beverages":1,"zero":1,"cost":1,"are":3,"cattle":1,"our":3,"beyond":1,"pale":1,"2.5":2,"really":1,"cargo":1,"for":12,"lots":1,"selected":1,"asking":2,"receiving":1,"highway":1,"told":1,"be":3,"we":6,"never":1,"recently":1,"hardship":1,"124\/person":1,"ingests":1,"hours":1,"reason":1,"nickled":1,"from":2,"change":2,"passengers":1,"essentially":1,"last":1,"carry-on":1,"of":9,"tipped":1,"experience":1,"thing":1,"amount":1,"usually":1,"dimed":1,"workarounds":1,"or":1,"first":2,"family":1,"1.5":2,"guaranteed":1,"vacation":1,"refill":1,"pre-selected":1,"my":3,"save":1,"fee":1,"checked":1,"service":4,"top":2,"there":4,"airlines":3,"insult":1,"few":2,"2":1,"call":1,"noticed":1,"time":1,"biggest":1,":":1,"was":8,"final":1,"``":2,"expedia":1,"flight":3,"option":1,"on":2,"hr":2,"spirit":2,"bereavement":1,"but":3,"it":2,"forward":1,"luckily":2,"with":2,"than":2,"women":1,"randomly":1,"13":1,"handling":1,"left":1,"being":3,"ap":3,"this":4,"us":1,"will":2,"matter":1,"anywhere":1,"can":2,"pre-select":1,".":18,"arrive":1,"treated":1,"medical":1,"deceased":1,"and":10,"passenger":1,"would":1,"oddity":1,"emphatically":1,"is":2,"dumped":1,"purse":1,"site":1,"''":2,"sibling":1,"as":1,"at":3,"have":1,"in":5,"bucks":1,"check":1,"!":7,"bags":1,"'ll":1,"no":5,")":4,"bereavement\/medical":1,"that":3,"tip":1,"airport":2,"who":1,"trip":1,"delay":1,"also":1,"other":2,"5":2,"which":1,"gate":1,"you":1,"waterbottles":1,"star":1,"attend":2,"wonderful":1,"welcome":1,"wrong":1,"plane":1,"liquids":1,"plenty":1,"a":12,"emergencies":1,"off":2,"third":1,"i":10,"wheelchair":2,"well":1,"options":1,"thought":1,"rather":1,"definitely":1,"so":2,"pay":2,"the":29,"coincided":1,"normally":1,"charged":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

The planes were relatively clean. The service was relatively decent, but the good points end here.\n\nWhat I really did not like about Spirit is that they charge just about everything including seats, checked bags, carry-on bags (if you don't pay at booking, they will sock you $100 a piece at the gate for your carry-on), beverages (including water, coffee, tea and soft drinks) and snacks! Paying for checked bags and even seats do not bug me too much but also paying for carry-on, water, soda, and snacks? Okay, maybe I also could live with charging for certain snacks, but charging for the rest of items is simply crazy! Especially if I have to be in an airplane for almost 4 hours?! \n\nAgain, I log about 40-50 thousand miles a year.  I have flown several different airlines. I have flown many \"low price\" airlines.  I travel economy or premium economy. I don't travel business or first class, but I haven't experienced a carrier who has failed to provide the value for me as miserably as Spirit. I have no problems with \"no frills\" airlines, but, when I don't feel the value as a customer, the company has failed. I don't feel the spirit or feel my spirit lifting after traveling with them. Instead, I feel regret for choosing this carrier. Charging your customers for one too many items, little items, isn't going to be a long-term winning business solution. There are plenty low fare carriers around. Most are doing much better than Spirit.\n\nUnless there aren't any other choices, I won't fly Spirit Airlines any longer, and I highly recommend you to avoid it as well.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2014-04-11","useful":6,"counts":{"all":1,"just":2,"over":1,"rest":1,"not":2,"including":2,"seats":2,"seemed":1,"$":1,"also":2,"(":3,",":23,"bug":1,"better":1,"to":6,"charge":1,"going":1,"4":1,"has":3,"do":5,"coffee":1,"his":1,"premium":1,"around":1,"relatively":2,"vegas":1,"they":2,"gate":1,"buyer":1,"highly":1,"like":1,"did":1,"solution":1,"charging":3,"try":2,"miles":2,"booking":1,"higher":1,"soft":1,"because":1,"miserably":1,"doing":1,"tea":1,"many":2,"decided":1,"traveling":1,"choosing":1,"year":2,"'s":2,"really":1,"even":1,"n't":8,"what":1,"for":10,"decision":1,"per":1,"everything":1,"asking":1,"remorse":1,"between":1,"40-50":2,"?":2,"be":2,"who":1,"business":3,"wo":1,"beverages":1,"here":1,"water":2,"were":3,"flyer":1,"let":1,"100":1,"hours":1,"about":4,"carry-on":3,"of":2,"could":1,"favorite":1,"carrier":3,"soda":1,"long-term":1,"or":4,"frequent":1,"first":1,"feel":4,"definitely":1,"one":1,"simply":1,"planes":2,"winning":1,"your":2,"regret":1,"little":1,"checked":2,"log":2,"service":1,"failed":2,"decent":1,"there":2,"sock":1,"airlines":5,".":17,"spirit":7,"live":1,"much":3,"too":2,"recommend":1,"was":1,"low":2,"``":2,"that":2,"with":3,"company":1,"but":5,"newer":1,"prices":1,"customer":1,"than":1,"especially":1,"me":2,"this":3,"say":1,"value":2,"choices":1,"will":1,"customers":1,"items":3,"piece":1,"my":3,"are":3,"and":5,"crazy":1,"snacks":3,"almost":1,"certain":1,"is":3,"it":1,"an":1,"''":2,"fly":1,"as":4,"good":1,"at":2,"have":5,"in":1,"airplane":1,"trip":1,"if":2,"!":3,"bags":3,"different":1,"end":1,"no":2,")":3,"pay":1,"travel":2,"when":1,"any":2,"paying":2,"other":1,"chicago\/las":1,"instead":1,"you":3,"several":1,"thousand":2,"economy":2,"fare":1,"experienced":1,"okay":1,"again":1,"price":1,"after":1,"problems":1,"them":1,"frills":1,"most":2,"flown":2,"plenty":1,"unless":1,"class":1,"lifting":1,"recent":1,"a":6,"drinks":1,"give":1,"longer":1,"i":17,"maybe":1,"carriers":2,"well":1,"provide":1,"points":1,"clean":1,"the":10,"avoid":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

was the cheapest airfare I found for a last minute flight from LAX to the Bay Area, and now I understand why. My flight costed me only $64, as compared to other airlines who were charging $180+, but...I have a three hour layover in Vegas, which by the way, is where I am drafting this review as I wait to board my next plane to Oakland. Some might say time is money, but I didn't really mind the layover. Besides now I have a few extra hours to catch up on my reviews. \n\nSo why the two stars? Oh where do I begin...\n\nWhen I checked-in online, I found that you are only allowed one personal bag (handbag, small backpack, etc.) free of charge and that they charge $35 for a carry-on, and even more for checked bags. But on that same page, they disclose that umbrellas, baby diaper bags, cameras, or food for the flight are not counted as carry-ons. I had an SLR camera bag and a handbag with me and was heading straight to the airport immediately after work, so I couldn't even go home to pack smarter after learning of their baggage fees. Since cameras were not counted as a carry on, I pulled out all the compartment walls from my camera bag to make one big compartment for my handbag. Luckily I had brought my denim LV bag, so it was much more pliable than most bags I have at home, and I carried my camera around my neck. \n\nSo I got around the baggage fee, but then the next page of the online check-in asks you to select a seat for a fee starting at $5. This page almost got me. It says that the green seat is me, grey seats are unavailable, and blue seats are available for purchase\/upgrade. I looked up and down the diagram of the plane multiple times, but did not see my seat anywhere. I thought I just had to pick a seat, but anywhere that I clicked on added an additional fee for the seat. My gosh! They charge for carry-on and seats??? Anyway, I decided to skip this step just to see what happens and they randomly assigned me to a seat. I usually prefer the window, but whatevers. I just saved myself $5-15. \n\nFinally, the flight. The plane itself looked pretty new and clean. Leg room wise... like what most people say... are minimal, if any. Lucky for me, I'm not even five feet of height, so there was enough leg room for me. The seats don't recline either, but you probably wouldn't want them to anyway because as Queen Latifah would say in Last Holiday, the person in front of you would practically be sitting in your lap. \n\nSince my fare was so cheap, and I had a layover in Vegas, I was curious to see what the cost of the fare would be to just fly from LAX to LAS (the first flight of my travel). I found that the fare costed $100 more than mine!!! So for my fellow flyers who were stopping in Vegas, they could've booked the LAX to OAK, got off in LAS, and disregard the flight to OAK. But I've heard that then you wouldn't be able to board the returning flight obviously because you're not returning from OAK, so all you have to do is book separate one-way departing and returning flights. \n\n(Lol... as I'm sitting at the gate waiting, a woman just walked by calling Spirit stupid.)\n\n**UPDATE**\nThree hours later, I'm still here in Vegas. And now my flight is delayed two hours. My plane is here, but we're waiting for the flight crew to come in from San Diego. Wtf happened to the crew on the plane that is sitting here at the gate? Now I'm not getting back to the Bay Area till the next morning at 12:40.  Awesome! I'm knocking off a star.\n\n**ANOTHER UPDATE**\nFinally got on the second plane and was not impressed. The plane looked old and dirty. Completely opposite of the first plane. To the point where it was gross. I'm just glad it got me to OAK safely.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2012-05-29","useful":1,"counts":{"all":2,"cameras":2,"looked":3,"just":6,"departing":1,"12:40":1,"money":1,"cost":1,"queen":1,"cheap":1,"anyway":2,"assigned":1,"front":1,"seats":4,"go":1,"still":1,"saved":1,"purchase\/upgrade":1,"calling":1,"clicked":1,"$":6,"till":1,"personal":1,"(":3,"backpack":1,"extra":1,"had":4,",":40,"crew":2,"lv":1,"to":26,"finally":2,"other":1,"board":2,"pretty":1,"skip":1,"holiday":1,"might":1,"happened":1,"...":5,"them":1,"woman":1,"around":2,"sitting":3,"food":1,"smarter":1,"online":2,"lucky":1,"so":8,"walls":1,"vegas":4,"**another":1,"they":5,"airfare":1,"not":7,"immediately":1,"now":4,"multiple":1,"minute":1,"brought":1,"like":1,"did":2,"pulled":1,"bay":2,"bag":4,"stupid":1,"check-in":1,"?":5,"flyers":1,"small":1,"found":3,"where":3,"page":3,"disclose":1,"because":2,"says":1,"who":2,"people":1,"begin":1,"some":1,"back":1,"seat":6,"blue":1,"one-way":1,"see":3,"decided":1,"are":5,"layover":3,"home":2,"'ve":2,"really":1,"happens":1,"gross":1,"what":3,"oakland":1,"unavailable":1,"for":13,"review":1,"since":2,"drafting":1,"waiting":2,"anywhere":2,"umbrellas":1,"new":1,"returning":3,"minimal":1,"either":1,"available":1,"be":3,"we":1,"update**":1,"do":3,"leg":2,"got":5,"180+":1,"free":1,"hours":3,"disregard":1,"step":1,"here":3,"besides":1,"from":5,"100":1,"come":1,"by":2,"wait":1,"on":6,"last":2,"carry-on":2,"oh":1,"whatevers":1,"of":9,"could":2,"completely":1,"35":1,"heading":1,"etc":1,"airport":1,"pick":1,"usually":1,"safely":1,"or":1,"first":2,"and":17,"wtf":1,"point":1,"denim":1,"checked-in":1,"knocking":1,"latifah":1,"one":2,"down":1,"64":1,"learning":1,"fees":1,"carry":1,"old":1,"gosh":1,"your":1,"select":1,"carry-ons":1,"impressed":1,"fee":3,"checked":1,"additional":1,"asks":1,"area":2,"would":5,"there":1,"window":1,"lol":1,"next":3,"few":1,"camera":3,"way":1,"which":1,"second":1,"compartment":2,"was":8,"is":7,"diego":1,"more":3,"only":2,"flight":9,"stars":1,"enough":1,"fly":1,"mind":1,"spirit":2,"getting":1,"delayed":1,"but":10,"it":4,"bags":3,"luckily":1,"understand":1,"diaper":1,"baby":1,"probably":1,"an":2,"with":1,"than":2,"glad":1,"carried":1,"me":8,"myself":1,"wise":1,"room":2,"hour":1,"cheapest":1,"this":3,"straight":1,"morning":1,"grey":1,"slr":1,"n't":5,"reviews":1,"'re":2,"three":2,"were":3,"stopping":1,"separate":1,"my":15,"feet":1,"pack":1,"catch":1,"flights":1,"have":4,"then":2,"almost":1,"awesome":1,"allowed":1,"am":1,"mine":1,"fellow":1,"randomly":1,"heard":1,"say":3,"itself":1,"at":5,"want":1,"curious":1,"5-15":1,"work":1,"their":1,"as":6,"if":1,"!":5,"thought":1,"compared":1,"able":1,"baggage":2,")":3,"make":1,"that":9,"oak":4,"off":2,"same":1,"any":1,".":37,"when":1,"book":1,"5":1,"airlines":1,"prefer":1,"big":1,"gate":2,"you":7,"out":1,"charging":1,"recline":1,"fare":3,"even":3,"costed":2,"added":1,"star":1,"time":1,"opposite":1,"after":2,"charge":3,"much":1,"diagram":1,"most":2,"plane":8,"lax":3,"two":2,"handbag":3,"'m":6,"lap":1,"why":2,"times":1,"a":13,"booked":1,"**update**":1,"in":9,"neck":1,"pliable":1,"practically":1,"i":34,"up":2,"later":1,"dirty":1,"walked":1,"obviously":1,"height":1,"person":1,"green":1,"clean":1,"las":2,"san":1,"five":1,"the":38,"starting":1,"counted":2,"travel":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

The customer service representatives are incredibly incompetent and I hate to sound racist because I'm mixed race myself, but these people CANNOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH and the miscommunication has cost me money, time, and energy.

What the fack?! No. I don't pay more money always. When flying southwest, changing a flight--even missing a flight costs little to nothing. Changing my flights with spirit and following THEIR bullshit rules that even they don't seem to understand cost me $438 extra, in addition to paying for my carry-on bag for all of those flights, paying the difference in cost for the flights (which I DO understand), and paying for some other random fee that the woman on the phone informed me she couldn't explain or pronounce.

Here's my review (and please check back for updates b\/c my plight isn't over):\n\nI am shacked up in a hotel right now b\/c of Spirit Airlines (one of their worthless planes broke down and I got bumped to the next day).  I just felt the urgency to come here to WARN anyone who is even THINKING about booking a flight through these incompetent hapless nincompoops, don't EVEN think  about it... seriously even if the flight is 200 DOLLARS LESS THAN ANYONE ELSE, it is not worth the tears.

My simple 6-7 hour travel day turned into 15 hours of frustration, for just a hundred dollars or so less than a more efficient. \n\nWhen you start adding up the costs you're often coming in around the same as many other airlines. They charge for everything - seat, carry on, water, coffee, fuel...... If you travel light, short distances, and aren't picky you can save big bucks on their specials. Especially with their $9 fare club. If you travel frequently it's worth the $59 annual fee. They really do have $39 flights. \n\nDownsides-\n\nCustomer service is not customer oriented or friendly.

Yet hear me out.  \n\nFlew super cheap from Dallas - Vegas.  They offer a $9 deal if you join their Spirit Club (*$60 annually).  Wife joined & can now book tickets for us both.  Many other reviews below detail the a la carte nature of the airline.  You've seen that.  Yes, if you don't want to pay $3 for bottled water, carry your airport drink onto the plane. BTW- they do have a 3 beer special (discount priced) !\n\nFor our recent Vegas flight, outbound trip departed at 1120 pm, about a half hour late.  Newer-looking Airbus--bad news--seats were as tight as advertised.  Because this was essentially a red eye flight, there were empty seats; even a few empty rows.  However we didn't have the good sense to scurry to an empty row when the doors closed.  Hence my wife stayed jammed up against the 6'4\" guy who had to literally straddle the seat in front of him (truly, just sitting upright was not an option).  Pilot & attendants had poor speaking voices; intercom was way too loud for a middle-of-the-night-flight; attendants were a tad rude; \n\nReturn flight, older Airbus, seats appeared more spacious.  Flight was totally full.  Crew was nicer this time as well.\n\nWhy the A-Ok?  Because we got to go to Vegas!  This trip was totally enabled by de minimis airfare, including one carry on bag fee.  Would we fly again? Yes.  Do we have our expectations locked in for next time? Absolutely.\n\nTip:  As soon as the doors close--scurry to any open seats. If you don't like sitting 3-to-a-row & have a flight longer than 90mins (as our 2:45 Vegas flight was), look to move.  Don't pay for your seat selection, because it won't do anything.  There is a row or two of bigger seats in the front for $65...if you're really motivated.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2012-01-25","useful":2,"counts":{"selection":1,"departed":1,"just":1,"from":1,"tip":1,"move":1,"cheap":1,"soon":1,"not":1,"bottled":1,"including":1,"seats":5,"go":1,"yes":2,"yet":1,"row":2,"one":1,"$":4,"la":1,"(":4,"had":2,",":12,"crew":1,"late":1,"to":8,"other":1,"spacious":1,"under":1,"minimis":1,"do":6,"good":1,"return":1,"sitting":2,"intercom":1,"de":1,"flew":1,"truly":1,"vegas":4,"they":2,"half":1,"front":2,"join":1,"now":1,"him":1,"bigger":1,"tickets":1,"like":1,"--":3,"joined":1,"'ve":1,"annually":1,"bag":1,"bad":1,"red":1,"newer-looking":1,"6'4":1,"did":1,"airfare":1,"carte":1,"few":1,"because":3,"deal":1,"1120":1,"advertised":1,"seat":2,"our":3,"special":1,"out":1,"even":1,"n't":5,"for":7,"literally":1,"3":2,"closed":1,"got":1,";":4,"?":3,"we":4,"full":1,"nature":1,"wo":1,"of":3,"however":1,"water":1,"discount":1,"rows":1,"news":1,"super":1,"guy":1,"both":1,"about":1,"anything":1,"many":1,"against":1,"3-to-a-row":1,"3*":1,"airport":1,"airline":1,"hence":1,"onto":1,"or":1,"drink":1,"*":1,"appeared":1,"expectations":1,"60":1,"jammed":1,"65":1,"carry":2,"next":1,"open":1,"your":2,"airbus":2,"2:45":1,"fee":1,"eye":1,"would":1,"&":3,"stretch":1,"there":2,"two":1,"by":1,"absolutely":1,"beer":1,"too":1,"way":1,":":1,"was":7,"empty":3,"pm":1,"attendants":2,"tight":1,"guidelines":1,"flight":6,"option":1,"that":1,"club":1,"spirit":1,"-":1,"essentially":1,"priced":1,"hear":1,"upright":1,"an":2,"than":1,"pilot":1,"me":1,"''":1,"locked":1,"look":1,"hour":1,"this":3,"wife":2,"enabled":1,"up":1,"us":1,"straddle":1,"reviews":1,"below":1,"'re":1,"can":1,"were":3,"more":1,"my":1,"at":1,"have":4,"nicer":1,"...":1,"is":1,"sense":1,"it":1,"voices":1,"tad":1,"fly":1,"as":6,"scurry":2,"want":1,"in":3,"close":1,"seen":1,"their":1,"90mins":1,"if":4,"!":2,"again":1,"speaking":1,"outbound":1,"dallas":1,")":4,"pay":2,"offer":1,"when":1,"detail":1,"stayed":1,"trip":2,".":23,"book":1,"doors":2,"9":1,"you":5,"really":1,"motivated":1,"poor":1,"a-ok":1,"rude":1,"any":1,"who":1,"plane":1,"middle-of-the-night-flight":1,"on":1,"totally":2,"why":1,"recent":1,"a":11,"longer":1,"yelp":1,"older":1,"loud":1,"btw-":1,"well":1,"time":2,"the":11},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

If I could give zero stars, I would! \nThis review is for the Spirit Customer service only, most especially directed at manager Josh \"Anderson\"( who i know gave me a false name).\nWhile waiting for a cab to take my friends and I to the airport for our return flight, one of my friends suddenly had a severe allergic reaction. Hives, swollen tongue, swelling all over, and possibly breathing issues. 911 was called, the fire dept and an ambulance came and she was taken to the ED. \nAs she was getting treated in the hospital, I decided to call customer service to see what I could do to change our flight as we were definitely not going to make it. I spoke to someone (I forgot his name, but almost as rude) and explained my situation and all he kept saying over and over again like a mantra, was how they can't do anything except give me a refund, which after all their extra fees were deducted, would come out to $12.79 \nIt was either that or forfeit everything. I explained that this was a medical emergency. I obviously could not leave a friend while she was in the emergency department in a different state, but this obviously had no effect on him whatsoever. \nI asked to speak to a manager and was transferred to the idiotically rude asshole Josh Anderson. I relayed my situation again and still got the same answer. I asked what I could do, what he could help me do and he had the audacity to tell me to catch my flight by myself if I really needed to leave. I asked him to find me the next available flight out, and he gave me some absurd time the next day and the day after with an absurd amount. I had had it. I asked to speak to a different person, he said no, he is as far as I get to speak to. He then goes on to tell me that if I don't make my flight and don't cancel it now with him I will lose my refund of 12.79 for my flight. Well I wish I could have told him to shove his measly $12.79 refund up his ass with a spiked bat, but I didn't. What am I going to do with $13 when he's charging me a one way fare price of almost $300. \nI asked him to transfer me to the spirit ticket counter (I didn't know at the time that they don't take calls but I'm sure he knew as well) and guess where this motherfucking asshole gave me the number to....custodial services. Well, message received loud and clear Josh Anderson! Thanks for making me feel like shit while waiting for a friend in the hospital and pissing me off. I hope you get everything you deserve and more!\nEven the custodian apologized on your behalf, was more helpful than you were and told me there was no number and that I was being fucked with and to just come to the airport and they can help me out.\nI ended up going to the airport while my friend was still in the hospital to sort everything out and the lady at the ticket counter thankfully helped me out.\nI had no problem with the flight, in fact, my return red eye was one of the smoothest flights I had ever been on. \nHowever, this was the first and definitely the last flight I would ever take on spirit. I will happily shell out more money for AA or united any day. I had heard terrible things about spirit airline before, but never expected this kind of insolent treatment.

Before departure, I was asked to placed my small purse under the seat in front of me per airline protocol. I slept through the whole hour flight. We landed around 7:20am and then I went straight home. Around 11am I realized that my purse was missing. I left it on the plane! I called Spirit Airlines Las Vegas to see if they found it. I was relieved when the lady on the phone was happy to tell me they found it and that I can pick it up at the Lost & Found located inside the Mccarran Airport Baggage Claim across Carousel 14. So I went to pick it up... only to find out that all the cash in my wallet including all of the foreign money I've collected for more than a decade from all countries I've visited, as well as the ones given to me by friends were gone. :'( I asked the staff at Spirit Airlines if they could at least give me an information as to who found my purse. I was told by their staff it's not their problem and to file a police report instead.\nNo effort was made by the staff whatsoever. I asked to speak to a manager, manager will call me back instead. I tried calling their manager directly but went straight to voice mail. Needless to say, I'm filing a police report, call their corporate until they do something about it, and will never fly Spirit Airlines ever again!","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2016-04-19","useful":2,"counts":{"all":3,"protocol":1,"money":1,"not":1,"manager":3,"including":1,"find":1,"decade":1,"staff":3,"police":2,"7:20am":1,",":6,"spirit":3,"to":13,"only":1,"whatsoever":1,"under":1,"mail":1,"then":1,"around":2,"vegas":2,"they":4,"front":1,"lady":1,"lost":1,"countries":1,"'ve":2,"small":1,"found":4,"went":3,"11am":1,"inside":1,"needless":1,"back":1,"seat":1,"see":1,"home":1,"morning":1,"out":1,"for":1,"placed":1,"per":1,"before":1,"ever":1,"across":1,"told":1,"we":1,"who":1,"missing":1,"never":1,"by":3,"baggage":1,"on":2,"about":1,"6am":1,"of":2,"could":1,"through":1,"foreign":1,"airport":1,"mccarran":1,"(":1,"whole":1,"asked":3,"claim":1,"directly":1,"speak":1,"given":1,"from":1,"&":1,"slept":1,"airlines":3,"least":1,".":13,"their":4,"call":2,"carousel":1,"collected":1,"188":1,":":1,"was":7,"tell":1,"happy":1,"flight":2,"that":3,"relieved":1,"but":1,"phone":1,"landed":1,"...":1,"effort":1,"than":1,"me":5,"made":1,"14":1,"hour":1,"this":1,"straight":2,"cash":1,"until":1,"will":2,"wallet":1,"can":1,"were":1,"report":2,"visited":1,"problem":1,"voice":1,"my":4,"called":1,"at":3,"and":4,"gone":1,"do":1,"purse":3,"it":7,"an":1,"fly":1,"say":1,"something":1,"file":1,"in":3,"as":3,"if":2,"!":2,"information":1,"no":1,"when":1,"located":1,"instead":2,"airline":1,"'s":1,"tried":1,"again":1,"pick":2,"plane":1,"'m":1,"friends":1,"las":2,"a":5,"realized":1,"give":1,"'":1,"i":17,"up":2,"calling":1,"well":1,"departure":1,"more":1,"ones":1,"so":2,"the":12,"corporate":1,"filing":1,"left":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

have to remember that you get what you pay for.  Spirit is the Motel 6 of the skies.\n\nI traveled to and from Minneapolis and Vegas this week and had some interesting experiences.  I'm a chill, go-with-the-flow kind of person and since I made it back and forth and lived to tell the tale, I'm pretty good with the whole situation.\n\nNo doubt - the flights are packed.  It's kind of like being in steerage on the Titanic.  They squeeze as many of you as they can into a tiny space, and avoid any frills so that they don't have to charge an arm and a leg.  And for a 3-hour flight it was tolerable.  \n\nI took the red-eye out and there wasn't much sleep to be had.  It's not the most comfortable of seating.  That - and one of the flight attendants sat in the back and griped to the other flight attendants the entire trip.  And she had one of those voices that was kind of shrill and annoying.  Think Valley girl meets Janice from Friends (only, no laugh - thank goodness).  I was pretty sick of her dramatic tales of gossip at 3 am by the time we landed at 6:30 am,  but we got there ahead of schedule and we lived!  \n\nThe flight home was a little more interesting.  It was scheduled to leave at 9:50 pm, but I began receiving emails several hours before alerting me to a delay.  That was nice - I got to spend a little more time in the Mall of America before turning in the rental car and heading back to Charles Lindbergh.  Anyway...once at the gate we started to get reports of mechanical failure of our plane in Houston (that's the same story all of my co-workers said they were told when they have flown on Spirit and were delayed in the past) and a new plane coming from Chicago to \"save the day\" we sat in the airport until after midnight before finally being able to board.  By now the natives were beyond restless.  \n\nOnce we got on the plane the real fun began.  Apparently a wheelchair bound patient had some sort of issue, forcing more delay as they decided that she wasn't going to be able to fly.  We were stuffed in like sardines and the A\/C vents were barely blowing so folks really began to get uptight.  In fact, one woman pretty much lost her crap, got up, stormed to the back of the plane, barricaded herself in the restroom for a while while the flight attendants attempted to get her to be a little more cooperative.  She wasn't having any of it, and eventually stormed out and back to her seat, brandishing profanity and attitude throughout the cabin.  My son and I sat mesmerized, but many of the others on the plane became vocal as well.  Some were shouting in support, others in protest.  All the while the two male fight attendants tried to get her to comply to the captain's order for all passengers to be seated and buckled up.  Eventually she sat down, but apparently by then the police had been called because the captain came back on the horn and told us all that we now were waiting for the police to come help a passenger off the plane.  More cheering, some boos...much entertainment.  When the police showed up they removed the not-so-compliant woman from the plane as politely as possible.  Again there were some cheers and some boos.  \n\nThis all took about another hour. Needless to say people were ticked.  I've learned that it isn't good to keep people from getting their Vegas on.  These people had money to drink and gamble and Spirit was cutting into their fun time.\n\nEventually we got off the ground and the captain ordered up a free soft drink for everyone.  Mighty nice of him, right?  But who really wants a Diet Coke at 2 am anyway?  \n\nIt made for a long night, but a certainly interesting flight.  I've never been on a plane where anyone was kicked off before.  Made for a good story for my friends and family.  And, this afternoon I opened up my email to find an apology from Spirit along with a $50 credit for both my son and I toward another flight in the future.  Fortunately my son is going to college in MN in the fall, so I guess we'll give it another try in August.\n\nAll in all, Spirit is a cheap way to get from point A to point B.  I only took a backpack with what I needed for a couple of days so I didn't have to pay for a checked or carry on bag.  I let them randomly seat us to avoid the charge to pick my own seats, and they sat us together on both trips.  And I planned ahead with my own snacks to avoid paying for them on the flight.  We both flew round trip for $180 without having to \"join the club\" for a better price.  I thought that was a pretty good deal.

Pay the additional fee to get one of the nicer seats, it makes a huge difference.  \n2) Try to get all your stuff into one super big luggage.  \n3) We took a backpack, and it was free, and that's where we kept our snacks or drinks (you are charged for them on the flight)\n4) I had awesome stewards\/stewardesses.\n\nJust one downside, we were delayed on the way home, which kind of sucked, but the pilot made up the time in the air so that was awesome.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":4,"date":"2012-08-12","useful":6,"counts":{"all":2,"just":2,"being":1,"cheap":1,"seats":3,"go":1,"still":1,"saved":1,"enjoyed":1,"upgrade":1,"$":1,"(":2,"backpack":1,"had":1,",":11,"knew":2,"to":5,"choose":1,"sucked":1,"them":1,"get":2,"big":1,"overall":1,"cursing":1,"vegas":1,"they":1,"despite":1,"not":1,"utmost":1,"difference":1,"cool":1,"prize":1,"try":1,"stuff":1,"check-in":1,"where":2,"mean":1,"because":1,"people":1,"some":1,"back":1,"are":2,"our":1,"ourselves":1,"drinks":1,"what":1,"give":1,"for":2,"wow":1,"3":2,"tips":1,"be":1,"we":6,"kicked":1,"however":1,"free":2,"super":3,"on":4,"getting":1,"of":3,"experience":1,"airline":2,"loud":1,"or":1,"430":1,"upgraded":1,"flying":1,"drunk":1,"into":2,"fancy":1,"one":4,"downside":1,"your":2,"fee":1,"from":2,"additional":1,"would":1,"few":1,"dfw":1,"there":1,"hey":2,".":7,"their":1,"2":1,"stewards\/stewardesses":1,"way":2,":":1,"was":5,"is":2,"4":1,"``":2,"flight":4,"that":5,"took":2,"redeye":1,"off":1,"with":1,"spirit":4,"pilot":1,"paying":1,"kind":1,"made":1,"slogan":1,"this":1,"luggage":1,"up":1,"air":1,"will":1,"i":6,"'re":2,"were":4,"my":4,"and":8,"supreme":1,"nicer":1,"snacks":1,"awesome":2,"it":2,"''":2,"in":1,"annoying":1,"any":1,"if":1,"!":3,"huge":2,")":6,"pay":1,"1":2,"other":1,"airlines":1,"which":1,"you":4,"'s":1,"pretzels":1,"who":1,"delayed":1,"but":1,"las":1,"a":5,"awesomeness":1,"kept":1,"especially":1,"home":1,"makes":1,"baggage":1,"so":4,"time":1,"the":9,"charged":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

It is a budget airline and if you want to travel a short distance at cheaper discounted prices, you can come here. I decided that the one time I would be on Spirit Airlines is for a quick flight from LAX to Vegas. It would only take 45 minutes and it will be worth the price. I can deal with the worn out seats, the cramped space, and the additional charges for luggage because I know that it is a discount airline. They will nickel and dime you ($100.00 +) for additional luggage carry on. It is pretty extreme, but I decided to brush it off.\n\nThe plane slowly started to take off and we started to see that there were already some problems: the plane was old and couldn't resist turbulence. For the first 15 minutes that the plane was in the air, the entire cabin was shaking around so much that the passengers started to hold on tightly to the walls of the plane. I felt nauseous by how much the plane was dropping up and down and twisting around. It didn't feel safe at all. \n\nThe second issue is that most of the flights are delayed. The planes arrive late frequently and it's hard to get to another connecting flight if it is an unreliable airline.\n\nThird issue is the customer service through the phone. I tried calling the 1-800 number for baggage service and information about the airline. There are only four options and you can not speak to a single operator. The phone line hangs up on you after 10 seconds if you don't respond. \n\nUnreliability is one thing. Just because you consider yourself a discount airline doesn't mean you should be making your flights not safe for your passengers. I'm sorry, but that is where I draw the line. No thanks, Spirit, not again. \n\nOn another note: Spirit Airlines will call themselves the fasted growing airline in the US. I just hope they look into replacing their airplane engines if they are honestly the fastest growing airline.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2014-06-03","useful":5,"counts":{"all":1,"45":1,"consider":1,"just":2,"four":1,"through":1,"thanks":1,"seats":1,"where":1,"$":1,"(":1,",":8,"should":1,"late":1,"to":10,"only":2,"pretty":1,"sorry":1,"worth":1,"hope":1,"me":1,"around":2,"get":1,"safe":2,"cheaper":1,"walls":1,"vegas":1,"know":1,"they":3,"not":3,"turbulence":1,"one":2,"entire":1,"did":1,"warned":1,"nauseous":1,"calling":1,"second":1,"quick":1,"shaking":1,"mean":1,"respond":1,"because":2,"old":1,"deal":1,"hard":1,"some":1,"budget":1,"resist":1,"carry":1,"see":1,"decided":2,"are":3,"out":1,"will":3,"for":6,"space":1,"+":1,"dime":1,"does":1,"connecting":1,"issue":2,"can":3,"be":3,"we":1,"felt":1,"seconds":1,"were":1,"here":1,"discount":2,"come":1,"by":1,"extreme":1,"passengers":2,"about":2,"would":2,"luggage":2,"of":2,"could":1,"thing":1,"airline":7,"options":1,"first":1,"already":1,"feel":1,"into":1,"number":1,"yourself":1,"down":1,"brush":1,"another":2,"operator":1,"your":2,"speak":1,"from":1,"additional":2,"service":2,"there":2,"airlines":3,"tightly":1,".":23,"their":1,"unreliability":1,"dropping":1,"slowly":1,"call":1,"themselves":1,":":2,"was":4,"cabin":1,"nickel":1,"on":5,"started":3,"delayed":1,"but":2,"phone":2,"1-800":1,"prices":1,"unreliable":1,"line":2,"hold":1,"with":1,"spirit":4,"customer":1,"distance":1,"15":1,"look":1,"100.00":1,"hangs":1,"up":2,"worn":1,"air":1,"n't":4,"i":10,"friend":1,"planes":1,"growing":2,"making":1,"arrive":1,"my":1,"and":11,"flights":2,"do":1,"minutes":2,"is":9,"it":9,"an":1,"single":1,"at":2,"want":1,"in":2,"flight":2,"airplane":1,"if":4,"again":1,"engines":1,"us":1,"no":1,")":1,"travel":1,"that":7,"off":2,"note":1,"how":1,"cramped":1,"take":2,"so":1,"you":8,"10":1,"draw":1,"'s":1,"tried":1,"information":1,"replacing":1,"price":1,"after":1,"problems":1,"much":2,"most":1,"plane":5,"lax":1,"frequently":1,"'m":1,"a":6,"short":1,"discounted":1,"third":1,"charges":1,"twisting":1,"baggage":1,"fasted":1,"honestly":1,"time":1,"the":27,"fastest":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":3}

We booked the cruise ship from Fort Lauderdale and our flight was from Las Vegas. The time of flight departure and our ship departure was more than 13 hours.

Night flight NK-954 was cancelled and the company for more than 2 hours did not want to give any information what is going on. They just were keeping saying that we will see a manager soon. When a manager shows up she didn't do anything to help us to get a different flight, she just offered a refund. At this point other flight from other carriers to Fort Lauderdale was gone. All morning flights were booked too. A flight at noon did not work for us, because the ship will be gone by this time. There were about 20 other people who were going to the same cruise. Who is going to return out money for a cruise ship? Spirit did not offer any compensation us others do. So we all lost vacations that we planned long time ago and money for the cruise.

Upon check in, there was a surprise $55 fee per checked bag and $100 FEE PER CARRY ON bigger than a purse EACH WAY. No cash was accepted at the check in, gate or in-flight. This was not a problem for us, but felt bad for any person who forgot theirs. Once on the plane, Spirit charges $3 per water, soda or juice (inc $3 per refill). Cheap snacks started at $3 per small courtesy size though $7 per \"luxury item\" of cup-o-soup noodles. Icing on the cake of poop experience was our airline server. Shocked in to tears of laughter, the woman with the beverages walked up and barked \"what do you want?!\" To our row. I asked to buy the Moscow mule. She said, \"where is your card? If it is not out of your wallet now I am going walking away. Other people want drinks and I don't have time for you to get out your wallet!\" LOL!!

Other airfares are running about 200 to 250 one way at this moment.  Spirit is $64 after tax but without any additional add ons and no baggage.  I'm allowed a free carry-on if it is the size of about a normal jansport backpack or regular sized laptop bag.\n\nBe aware that each baggage is about $36 bucks additional to airfare and if you do not pay for baggage online it will be about $100 at the airport.\n\nYou have options to pick a seat for 5-12 dollars more but I was told by friends to not pick a seat and they will give you a random seat when you check in 24 hours before flight.\n\nI've read the reviews and I'm prepared for the worst.  I still went along and purchased the ticket because I'm only going back for a tattoo appointment for one day and riding back up with a friend.  I was told be prepared for your flight to be delayed because spirit will keep delaying your flight until the plane is full or close to it.  So I picked the latest flight hoping that it will get delayed no more than 2 hours.. possibly 3.  With the amount of money I'm saving, I'm willing to wait.\n\nIf you forgot your password and decided to reset it, they will not send you an email for at least one hour because that's how long i waited before I called in.  The default password is 4Change and you will have 5 minutes to change your password.  My theory of why they do this is because if you check in at the airport it will cost you another 10 dollars.  If you do decide to call in, expect a phone call that sounds like you are driving under a bridge or in an elevator.\n\nI don't write reviews but thought this might help someone so there it is.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2014-09-17","useful":0,"counts":{"least":1,"allowed":1,"help":1,"money":1,"laptop":1,"random":1,"still":1,"yet":1,"regular":1,"before":3,"24":1,"$":3,"backpack":1,",":4,"send":1,"spirit":2,"to":11,"add":1,"going":1,"under":1,"riding":1,"might":1,"do":4,"someone":1,"appointment":1,"get":1,"read":2,"possibly":1,"vegas":1,"worst":1,"they":3,"airfare":1,"not":4,"2":1,"ticket":2,"password":3,"day":1,"minute":1,"like":1,"'ve":1,"sized":1,"bag":1,"have":3,"each":1,"went":1,"because":4,"airfares":1,"back":2,"seat":3,"decided":1,"are":2,"picked":1,"forgot":1,"close":1,"250":1,"will":7,"for":7,"please":1,"3":1,"email":1,"booking":1,"told":2,"be":4,"full":1,"theory":1,"jansport":1,"free":1,"hours":1,"100":1,"by":1,"change":1,"wait":1,"about":4,"last":1,"carry-on":1,"of":3,"dollars":2,"36":1,"keep":1,"airport":2,"plane":1,"pick":2,"options":1,"waited":1,"this":4,"saving":1,"one":3,"running":1,"4change":1,"64":1,"elevator":1,"another":1,"hours..":1,"ons":1,"sounds":1,"your":4,"size":1,"from":1,"additional":2,"there":1,"only":1,"long":1,".":17,"willing":1,"call":2,"way":1,"was":2,"until":1,"friend":1,"more":2,"5-12":1,"flight":5,"that":4,"delayed":2,"but":4,"aware":1,"phone":1,"with":2,"than":1,"reset":1,"10":1,"hour":1,"default":1,"up":1,"reviews":2,"below":1,"cost":1,"my":1,"called":1,"expect":1,"and":8,"bridge":1,"hoping":1,"give":1,"minutes":1,"is":7,"delaying":1,"tax":1,"it":7,"an":2,"n't":1,"at":4,"purchased":1,"in":5,"bucks":1,"decide":1,"any":1,"if":5,"tattoo":1,"no":2,"pay":1,"when":1,"amount":1,"check":2,"write":1,"how":1,"other":1,"5":1,"online":1,"you":11,"200":1,"'s":1,"normal":1,"after":1,"prepared":2,"moment":1,"flown":1,"lax":1,"along":1,"'m":5,"friends":1,"why":1,"las":1,"a":10,"booked":1,"driving":1,"i":15,"or":3,"thought":1,"baggage":3,"without":1,"so":2,"the":10,"latest":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

No exaggeration.  Their website and computer systems were down and they had no back up plan.  They were issuing boarding passes manually and it was taking a while.  Their staff was reassuring us though that they were delaying all flights so everyone would have a chance to board.  \n\nWe eventually got to our gate and the plane was still there but there was no info on the TV monitors.  And then I turn around and the plane is gone.  About 25 of us were supposed to be on that flight and when we inquired they told us it had already left.  Then no one at the gate wanted to help us figure out what to do.  Eventually after much yelling at them to pay attention to us they redirected us down to the ticketing counter to reschedule our departure.  In total about 40 people had missed their departure due to Spirit's lack of communication.  \n\nWe ended up on a flight the next morning meaning myself and many other people missed work.

If by some stroke of luck you're reading this before you buy, heed my warning: CLOSE OUT OF THE BROWSER NOW.\n\nLadies and gentleman, this for me was a lesson on the old adage: \"You get what you pay for.\"\n\nWhile I was stuck on the tarmac in Vegas, probably 100 yards away from my gate for 30 minutes after a 90 minute delay, I read reviews about how Spirit Airlines was the Greyhound of airline companies. \n\nThis is an accurate representation of the flight. Everything seems old, I honestly thought the plane was going to fall apart a couple of times on the round trip. The seating is cramped, and you will be charged for anything under the sun.  Baggage claim was very annoying.\n\nThat amazing price is not so amazing after you add 70 bucks of baggage fees each way, plus 10 bucks to choose your seat (each way). Also don't bother choosing your seat. It really makes no difference, you are going to get screwed no matter what.\n\nI told myself that If I won 600 bucks in Vegas I was going to just book a new one way ticket via any other airline back to Houston because I didn't want to experience Spirit Airlines a second time around.\n\nAt this moment, I'd give spirit 1 star because it was so bad.  Luckily they recovered for the return trip. Things went on without a hitch, kind of... There was still a delay, but it wasn't that horrible - typical really of any airline. I did feel like the plane was about to fall apart on take off and landing, but I guess I survived to tell the tale. Fine, you get 2 stars Spirit Airlines.\n\nBottom line: Make your trip to Vegas a fun one. Don't book Spirit becuase you end up spending the money you saved on baggage fees anyway. You'll also be annoyed with about 70% of the flight for various reasons.\n\ntl;dr: This buzzfeed captures it perfectly: http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/sapna\/what-its-like-to-fly-spirit-airlines","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":2,"date":"2013-06-16","useful":18,"counts":{"houston":1,"help":1,"just":1,"money":1,"accurate":1,"anyway":1,"hitch":1,"still":1,"fine":1,"before":1,"delay":2,"difference":1,"how":1,"(":1,"seems":1,",":13,"to":9,"add":1,"going":3,"choose":1,"my":2,"captures":1,"pay":1,"gate":1,"take":1,"do":2,"return":1,"around":1,"get":3,"read":1,"couple":1,"myself":1,"vegas":3,"they":1,"fall":2,"not":1,"ticket":1,"now":1,"dr":1,"minute":1,"apart":2,"like":1,"did":2,"companies":1,"honestly":1,"'ve":1,"bad":1,"heed":1,"each":2,"went":1,"round":1,"luck":1,"seating":1,"because":2,"old":2,"some":1,"back":1,"feel":1,"seat":2,"second":1,"are":1,"choosing":1,"close":1,"out":1,"reviews":1,"what":2,"for":6,"bottom":1,"saved":1,"review":1,"gentleman":1,"tarmac":1,"everything":1,"won":1,"various":1,"horrible":1,"screwed":1,"probably":1,";":1,"reading":2,"told":1,"be":2,"after":3,"'ll":1,"adage":1,"yards":1,"100":1,"by":1,"on":6,"about":3,"anything":1,"of":9,"30":1,"experience":1,"times":1,"plane":2,"plus":1,"airline":3,"makes":1,"book":2,"ladies":1,"via":1,"reasons":1,"one":2,"thought":1,"fees":2,"lesson":1,"your":3,"cramped":1,"guess":1,"from":1,"spending":1,"there":1,"tl":1,".":20,"stuck":1,"2":1,"way":3,":":6,"was":10,"tell":1,"recovered":1,"``":1,"buy":1,"flight":3,"stars":1,"that":3,"under":1,"star":1,"landing":1,"luckily":1,"survived":1,"90":1,"line":1,"with":1,"spirit":6,"me":1,"10":1,"kind":1,"perfectly":1,"this":6,"bother":1,"buzzfeed":1,"up":1,"will":1,"matter":1,"while":1,"'re":2,"fun":1,"minutes":1,"browser":1,"and":3,"claim":1,"600":1,"...":1,"is":3,"greyhound":1,"it":4,"an":1,"''":1,"n't":4,"stroke":1,"warning":1,"at":1,"want":1,"in":2,"bucks":3,"annoying":1,"trip":3,"if":3,"really":2,"%":1,"no":2,")":1,"things":1,"make":1,"-":1,"off":1,"any":2,"1":1,"also":2,"amazing":2,"other":1,"airlines":4,"new":1,"you":14,"becuase":1,"http":1,"price":1,"time":1,"moment":1,"'d":1,"but":2,"away":1,"70":2,"end":1,"sun":1,"\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/sapna\/what-its-like-to-fly-spirit-airlines":1,"a":9,"booked":1,"give":1,"i":11,"tale":1,"baggage":3,"without":1,"so":2,"god":1,"very":1,"representation":1,"the":14,"charged":1,"annoyed":1,"typical":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":3}

I only booked the flight 3 days in advance due to the circumstances. Everything was done online. Spent around $150 round trip. When booking online you can make an account and earn miles everytime you fly. They also tell you 1 carry-on bag is allowed for FREE. Since I realized I'd only be in town a few days, I agreed to take ONLY one bag. I also saw online that you'll be charged $100 a bag at the gate instead of the normal $30 if you don't use the online bag purchase service listed. I printed my ticket off my computer which had a bar code, so I knew \"pre check in\" wasn't needed. Saves $10 at the gate. The website CLEARLY states how they're a cheap airline and must charge for every little thing! They even do it in a funny way, by making jokes about it throughout the website, FB page and the on board menu. It gives you the COMPLETE run down on size diameters for your 1 free carry-on luggage. I'm seeing other reviews talking about bag fees and seating comfort issues as if they expected something different from a self proclaimed \"cheapest airlines around\" Your fault for not taking the time to actually read your itinerary! Everything is in bold print right in front of you people, quit complaining about things you already should have been aware of. Personally my flight was great. I went to McCarran a day early to see if my bag was regulation size and it was, just needed to make sure. The lady at the counter gave me a window seat next to the emergency exit door since it has around 12 inches more leg room. I thanked her dearly. The day of my flight was as smooth as silk. Went through security, sat down at my gate, won $35 on a slot machine. Flight was on time, & landed in Cleveland within 3 1\/2 hours, no issues. Phone on airplane mode the whole time, with my headphones in, to my downloaded music. Brung my own water and chips on the flight since I already knew they'd charge alot for everything. Came back 3 days later on a red eye, same emergency exit window seat. Again, brung my own water and snacks on the flight. So to avoid posting a low star review of this airline, do some research and use your brain, otherwise you'll be spending as much as AA or United flight. Then you'll feel like a total tool because you didn't listen.

Here is why:\n\n1) It is nearly impossible to speak to a representative. The website is created to deflect angry patrons from being able to talk to an agent. After finally getting the number and having to be routed through a serpentine path of automated redirecting, I finally got a hold of an agent after about 20 minutes. And when I'm finally on the line with one, absolutely no offense intended, but she barely spoke English and I had to have her repeat herself multiple times because I honestly couldn't understand her. This elevated my frustrations. \n\n2) There are high fees for cancellation or rescheduling. $240 was tacked onto my bill. You won't get that with Southwest. \n\n3) You have to pay for a carry-on. I understand with baggage. But really, even a carry-on? Southwest allows a carry-on and checked in baggage... guess what - for free. They even charge you if you don't have a boarding pass ready.

You would think I would have it duly memorized since during both legs of my trip, the flight attendant came on like every 5 minutes to brag about it.  And to harass you into signing up for their exclusive Visa.  And the continual announcements with the full cabin lights on, take place at 1:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m.  Apparently, they would have to charge you extra if you actually were able to fall asleep fully upright in the world's most uncomfortable seat built.  Spirit Airlines must have consulted with some sort of S&M design group when they engineered their seating.  I think they took a concrete bench from HomeDepot and slapped some faux-leather grey canvas on it, and voila, a seat was born.  Just to drive this point home:  I am a hair over 5 feet tall (maybe 5-1 if I have a great yoga or Pilates Reformer session) and weigh about 105 pounds, and this was undoubtedly, the most uncomfortable I have ever been in my life.  I felt cramped, pinched and claustrophobic.\n\nAnd if you are thinking, well, they are a low cost airline, of course, the seats and amenities cannot be luxurious, what can you expect?  Bottom line, they are not as low cost as they portray themselves and their version of cheap actually comes topped off with equally bad service .  So, you pay more than you expected and suffer while not saving anything.  So, they are indeed the double whammy of awful.\n\nAs others have mentioned their hidden fees are ridiculous and the staff are about as unpleasant as they come.  I was a few pounds over the 40 pound limit and was told in LV that I could transfer some of my things out of my checked bag into my purse, but I would have to re-wait back in the full line again when it had already taken me over 30 minutes to reach the counter.  And by this point, the line was even longer.  So, I ended up having to pay another $ 25 for my checked bag.  Total cost of checking 1 bag roundtrip $ 91!\n\nAfter I came home, I re-researched my roundtrip flight (LV to DFW) and in the end, after all their crappy fees, it would have been cheaper for me to have flown another (more reputable) airline.\n\nIt was my first and last Spirit trip.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2012-04-30","useful":1,"counts":{"exclusive":1,"all":1,"just":1,"being":1,"indeed":1,"over":3,"able":1,"cheap":1,"felt":1,"upright":1,"course":1,"session":1,"topped":1,"seats":1,"mentioned":1,"suffer":1,"staff":1,"25":1,"group":1,"$":2,"reformer":1,"(":3,"extra":1,"had":1,",":22,"actually":2,"lv":2,"to":11,"charge":1,"unpleasant":1,"voila":1,"hidden":1,"checking":1,"engineered":1,"cheaper":1,"faux-leather":1,"every":1,"they":8,"fall":1,"not":3,"during":1,"91":1,"like":2,"pounds":2,"fully":1,"with":3,"bag":3,"bad":1,"reputable":1,"bench":1,"signing":1,"some":3,"back":1,"seat":2,"hair":1,"born":1,"cost":4,"asleep":1,"are":6,"uncomfortable":2,"home":2,"out":1,"even":1,"canvas":1,"pilates":1,"for":3,"bottom":1,"since":1,"slapped":1,"p.m.":1,"lights":1,"version":1,"announcements":1,"claustrophobic":1,"ever":1,"?":1,"told":1,"pinched":1,"be":1,"full":2,"s":1,"whammy":1,"p.m":1,"others":1,"from":1,"attendant":1,"luxurious":1,"come":1,"by":1,"105":1,"both":1,"about":3,"last":1,"would":5,"world":1,"memorized":1,"of":8,"could":1,"30":1,"thinking":1,"harass":1,"visa":1,"brag":1,"airline":2,"think":2,"comes":1,"first":2,"equally":1,"already":1,"saving":1,"point":2,"into":2,"seating":1,"feet":1,"likes":1,"another":2,"fees":2,"total":1,"checked":2,"service":1,"&":1,"transfer":1,"dfw":1,"airlines":2,"been":2,".":18,"few":1,"amenities":1,"low":3,"expected":1,"themselves":1,"legs":1,"was":6,"cabin":1,"more":2,"sort":1,"life":1,"flight":2,"on":3,"duly":1,"am":1,"spirit":3,"great":1,"but":1,"crappy":1,"taken":1,"ridiculous":1,"ended":1,"continual":1,"5-1":1,"line":3,"undoubtedly":1,"than":1,"must":1,"me":2,":":1,"anything":1,"this":3,"double":1,"when":2,"grey":1,"us":1,"i":12,"while":1,"limit":1,"can":2,"were":1,"design":1,"ultra":1,"my":8,"1:00":1,"and":16,"pound":1,"concrete":1,"up":2,"minutes":2,"purse":1,"it":6,"as":6,"itself":1,"homedepot":1,"re-researched":1,"have":9,"in":5,"11:00":1,"apparently":1,"their":5,"if":3,"portray":1,"again":1,"yoga":1,"built":1,"something":1,"re-wait":1,"pay":2,"that":2,"-":1,"expect":1,"40":1,"trip":2,"1":1,"5":2,"take":1,"tout":1,"you":8,"!":1,"'s":2,"after":2,"reach":1,"what":1,"took":1,"most":2,"m":1,"flown":1,"tall":1,"awful":1,"end":1,"consulted":1,"a":6,"off":1,"longer":1,"roundtrip":2,"maybe":1,"counter":1,"well":1,"drive":1,"or":3,")":3,"cramped":1,"so":3,"place":1,"things":1,"at":1,"weigh":1,"the":14,"having":1,"came":2},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}

I talked to several people at Spirit Airlines customer service on the phone.

I never got my $50 credit and neither did my wife.  I called Spirit last week to see what happened to my credit.  The customer service agent I talked to this time told me they've never heard of such a thing.\n\nThe reason for 2 stars is that it's inexpensive.

I am not complaining of the overhead baggage cost as they mention it in their guidelines and neither I am complaining about the fact that one needs to pay for soda (I honestly don't care about having a soda during a flight). But people should consider the additional charges while calculating the fare. Spirit Airlines charges $40 for carry-on bags that fit in the overhead bins. So the round trip fare will increase by $80, if one has carry-on bags that don't fit below the seat. The normal seats are really cramped and for a slightly taller person, s\/he will have a hard time fitting into that space. If one needs more spacious seats (not talking about comfort; this is primarily to ensure that one doesn't develop a back ache), it will be another $13 or $26 for a round trip. So, the overall cost can be easily $100 more than your original ticket price. After traveling in greyhound buses during my student life 8 - 10 years back, I will say the comfort level with Spirit Air is worse than that of a Greyhound bus. On top of all these, I will add the ill-mannered flight crew\/staff. During one of my flights, people complained about dirty restroom and the air hostess plainly said that one shouldn't expect the comfort and luxury of a home\/resort during a flight. Not sure whether these staff ever go through any behavioral training! After traveling in 4 continents (US\/Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia\/New Zealand), I have no hesitation in saying that this is the worst airlines I have ever traveled in.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2012-07-13","useful":0,"counts":{"saying":1,"taller":1,"consider":1,"all":1,"years":1,"through":1,"ill-mannered":1,"seats":2,"go":1,"staff":1,"26":1,"$":5,"fit":2,"(":3,",":12,"should":2,"to":2,"add":1,"spacious":1,"8":1,"has":2,"do":2,"worse":1,"overall":2,"mention":1,"worst":2,"they":1,"not":3,"during":4,"ticket":1,"traveled":1,";":1,"easily":1,"level":1,"whether":1,"round":2,"primarily":1,"people":2,"guidelines":1,"back":2,"seat":1,"cost":2,"are":1,"80":1,"really":1,"will":5,"said":1,"hesitation":1,"for":4,"space":1,"below":1,"asia":1,"increase":1,"does":1,"neither":1,"ever":2,"s\/he":1,"europe":1,"be":2,"airways":1,"us\/canada":1,"ache":1,"100":1,"by":1,"care":1,"on":1,"about":4,"carry-on":2,"of":5,"restroom":1,"ensure":1,"soda":2,"slightly":1,"or":1,"this":2,"plainly":1,"buses":1,"into":1,"australia\/new":1,"one":6,"another":1,"your":1,"additional":1,"service":1,"top":1,"airlines":3,".":12,"their":1,"overhead":2,"time":1,"4":1,"traveling":2,"complained":1,"life":1,"hard":1,"flight":3,"continents":1,"that":9,"am":2,"spirit":3,"training":1,"but":1,"with":1,"than":2,"10":1,"13":1,"hostess":1,"these":2,"as":1,"can":1,"air":2,"n't":4,"charges":2,"while":1,"dirty":1,"more":2,"my":2,"expect":1,"and":4,"flights":1,"is":3,"greyhound":2,"it":2,"talking":1,"say":1,"have":4,"in":7,"seen":1,"any":2,"if":2,"!":1,"bags":2,"needs":2,"develop":1,"person":1,")":3,"pay":1,"comfort":3,"-":1,"40":1,"trip":2,"fitting":1,"luxury":1,"bus":1,"so":2,"fare":2,"sure":1,"calculating":1,"normal":1,"price":1,"after":2,"a":9,"student":1,"crew\/staff":1,"zealand":1,"i":8,"no":1,"having":1,"complaining":2,"baggage":1,"cramped":1,"honestly":1,"bins":1,"behavioral":1,"home\/resort":1,"the":14,"original":1,"fact":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

Their was a message stating that there has been a change in my flight. I tried calling the airline and the customer service representative couldn't find out what the change was. After about 30 minutes she stated that my flight was cancelled. I told her I needed to return to Florida. I told her i needed to leave as soon as possible so that  I could return to work on 6.21.16 (Tuesday). The representative stated that the earliest flight she had for 6.20.16 @ 8:40 p.m. arriving in Florida 9:50 a.m. Tuesday morning. I left the hotel and went to the airport. Once at the airport I found out that the pilots were on strike. So there was no guarantee that that flight would even take place.  I went back to the hotel. the following morning i was able to find a flight leaving @ 5:26 p.m. arriving Tuesday @ 5:23 a.m. Of course they didn't have any non stop flights for that time frame.

Which is why I had to book my guy four separate flights to get to and from a work conference in Orlando: one from LAS to DFW, another from DFW to Orlando, then the same in reverse to return, in order to get the best final price.\n\nFirst flight was delayed and then cancelled. No contact was made to alert me of this prior to arriving at the airport. Every other airline I've flown has texted and\/or called me in a timely manner. Had to make two trips in one hour to our lovely airport to retrieve my guy. Staff had absolutely no ability to reschedule anything or come up with any possible solutions. This airline only seems to have evening\/red-eye flights, so next available flight was 24 hours away, which didn't work for the conference we were travelling for in the first place.\n\nSince rescheduling with the same airline was not an option, had to shell out last-minute ticket prices for American Airlines- twice the price. Spirit has very strict policies\/rules about when\/how to request refunds, and I'm happy someone informed me that they are only able to issue one refund per trip per person. In other words, if your first flight has an issue, don't do anything about it until you have thoroughly completed your travel with Spirit. Because if you have additional issues getting home, they won't be able to do anything. Which makes no sense at all.\n\nReturn flight was also delayed, but luckily not cancelled. Which isn't to say it's wasn't without irritation. What was supposed to be a 11PM arrival barely made it around 1:30AM. Luckily I didn't have work in the morning.\n\nOverall flight experience is miserable. Tiny-ass seats, very strict luggage requirements, steep fees for every little thing, not even water is free of charge in the air. Basically, you can only travel with a lunchbox unless you want to shell out $40-50, because they will literally charge you $100 at the gate to CARRY ON a bag. Even if it's a duffel bag. Because lord knows if you ain't got no leg room, your weekend bag isn't likely to fit under the seat in front of you, either.\n\n**IF YOU ARE CARRYING ON LUGGAGE, take your bag to the airport and make sure it fits in their little container. Otherwise, the fees you pay will eliminate any savings you get on the ticket price. Consider yourself warned!**\n\nI love saving money, but I wont be doing this again.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2014-05-21","useful":9,"counts":{"detective":1,"refund":1,"all":1,"words":1,"money":1,"cheap":1,"four":1,"arriving":1,"reschedule":1,"solutions":1,"aspect":1,"seats":1,"love":1,"rescheduling":1,"issues":1,"staff":1,"24":1,"$":2,"fit":1,"front":1,"had":4,",":22,"to":26,"flights":2,"book":1,"under":1,"duffel":1,"lord":1,"travelling":1,"has":3,"policies\/rules":1,"pay":1,"then":2,"someone":1,"return":2,"around":1,"get":3,"very":2,"overall":1,"possible":1,"every":3,"they":3,"supposed":1,"not":3,"ticket":2,"one":3,"timely":1,"did":2,"warned":1,"11pm":1,"orlando":2,"'ve":1,"twice":1,"either":1,"guy":2,"available":1,"because":3,"retrieve":1,"when\/how":1,"absolutely":1,"airlines-":1,"some":1,"seat":1,"likely":1,"are":2,"irritation":1,"our":1,"morning":1,"best":2,"out":2,"1:30am":1,"n't":8,"what":1,"and\/or":1,"container":1,"for":4,"bag":4,"literally":1,"nightmare":1,"since":1,"per":2,"your":4,"eliminate":1,"got":1,"issue":2,"evening\/red-eye":1,"arrival":1,"be":3,"we":1,"unless":1,"ability":1,"leg":1,"wo":1,"free":1,"hours":1,"separate":1,"100":1,"come":1,"water":1,"about":2,"reverse":1,"anything":3,"luggage":2,"of":4,"barely":1,"experience":1,"called":1,"prior":1,"airport":3,"place":1,"airline":4,"makes":1,"or":1,"first":3,"this":5,"saving":1,"final":1,"seems":1,"yourself":1,"contact":1,"another":1,"fees":2,"carry":1,".":26,"consider":1,"**if":1,"40-50":1,"conference":2,"little":2,"from":3,"additional":1,"their":1,"dfw":2,"informed":1,"charge":2,"next":1,"doing":1,"until":1,"lovely":1,"was":7,"strict":2,"happy":1,"miserable":1,"only":3,"flight":5,"option":1,"that":1,"tiny-ass":1,"delayed":2,"but":2,"luckily":2,"carrying":1,"basically":1,"prices":1,"texted":1,"with":4,"spirit":2,"me":3,"made":2,"room":1,"hour":1,"pain-":1,"getting":2,"up":1,"air":1,"will":2,"'re":1,"can":1,"last-minute":1,"were":1,"cancelled":2,"steep":1,"trips":1,"at":3,"and":4,"have":5,"do":4,"ai":1,"is":8,"sense":1,"completed":1,"it":5,"an":2,"say":1,"shell":2,"manner":1,"want":1,"home":1,"scheduling":1,"my":2,"work":4,"any":2,"if":4,"!":1,"again":1,"requirements":1,"knows":1,"thing":1,"wont":1,":":1,"make":3,"able":2,"american":1,"same":2,"lunchbox":1,"also":1,"other":2,"take":1,"which":4,"gate":1,"you":12,"company":1,"even":2,"trip":1,"sure":2,"'s":2,"though":1,"price":4,"alert":1,"flown":1,"two":1,"**":1,"fits":1,"'m":1,"on":3,"weekend":1,"why":1,"las":1,"a":8,"in":11,"refunds":1,"i":6,"no":4,"request":1,"order":1,"person":1,"savings":1,"without":1,"so":1,"thoroughly":1,"the":15,"otherwise":1,"away":1,"travel":2},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":3}

DO NOT FLY WITH THEM. Flying there, I was greeted with a choice of $50 to carry on my luggage or $45 to check it. I brought one luggage to check and two carry ons with my fiance. We thought we would be saving money by each having a carry on instead of another checked bag, but this was not the case! It cost us $95 to check one bag and for the other carry on! A small roller that I have used on other airlines that fits in the carry on box. Nope, not here, $50 for it. Staff did not give a flying S and were extremely rude and condescending. I was then charged $16 to sit next to my fiance instead of taking random seats. Whoever heard of such an absurd charge!? These people are thieves and they will charge you for anything and everything. At the gate to board the plane, they saw the charge on my fiance's ticket that showed he payed for the bag and he had boarding for zone 1. But since I did not pay for a bag, I had boarding zone 4. They started giving me a hard time about boarding with my fiance! After explaining, I just took my ticket and walked on the plane. They were so rude. \nOn the way back, we payed online and saved a whopping $10! $85 instead of $95! Horrible. Almost $200 in baggage fees round trip. Oh and did I mention the weight limit is 40 pounds, not the standard 50 pounds? Yes, they are 40! Coming back, our checked bag was 44 so the lovely lady told us to remove 2 pounds to get it to 42 and that would be ok. So we took stuff out, weighed it and it was 40.5\/41 bouncing back and forth. She asked what it was and I replied it is going back and forth between 40.5\/41. You said you would take 42 so it's fine. She then retorted back very rudely, well I didn't have to do that for you!

This airlines sucks! Avoid at all costs and don't even waste the time reading anymore of this! Just stay away!\n\nThis airline is hands down the absolute worst carrier currently operating in the United States. I have had the opportunity to experience it first hand in several cities and I ask myself why I keep going back. Honestly, I am not always the one booking it and I have no say in the matter, but when I do I avoid at all costs. \n\n-Awful flights that feel as if the pilots are new on the job or operating a plane that needs to be checked out. I understand turbulence and and such, but no excuse for not changing altitude or a rough landing or takeoff a with dramatic movements every which way. They are old planes that should be taken out of service. I have flown in nicer planes in third world countries!\n\n-Very unfriendly staff! It is like everyone hates their job and they are in no way able to try and assist you. Have had issues with planes being late or sitting on them waiting for takeoff and there is never valid reasons this occurs and never people working there that seem apologetic. Like making you board a plane in 10 minutes and then making you sit there for an hour before take off.\n\n-Zero comfort! If it is not already bad that you have a awful ride and unfriendly people that are helping you... You get to sit on top of the person next to you with zero leg room  and no entertainment options. Total crap in every way!\n\n-Cheap and not inexpensive! These two words seem similar, but they are not at all. This airlines always has the lowest price and even days up until traveling they offer this, but remember to add the cost of water, carry on bags and a number of other add on a that make absolutely no sense. They also have a Scam ring with their supposed saving club. Sign up and even if you unsubscribe it keeps you there and you are required to call after you see it on your credit card statement.

At least they're honest about what to expect as a potential Spirit customer! Spirit Airlines was recommended to me by a co-worker because they offer some of the cheapest flights to Denver, CO from McCarran Airport. A round-trip flight from Las Vegas to Denver was $53 per person, which is a steal in my book. My co-worker actually got cheaper tickets at $28 round-trip! \nPRO TIP: Buy your tickets in-person at Spirit Airlines at the airport to save $36 for a round-trip ticket or $18 one-way. Whatever it says online, it will be $18 or $36 cheaper.\n\nIf people just did a little research, you could avoid all the \"invisible fees\". First off, customers are entitled to a \"personal item\" free of charge. I brought on a Jansport backpack and my husband brought a sizable military issued backpack as his personal item. We had absolutely no problems taking these aboard. Second, get acquainted with online check-in to print your boarding pass. Otherwise, it's $10 to get it printed at the airport. You can check-in 24 hours early and no later than 1 hour before your flight departs. Third, to avoid a seat selection fee, just choose the \"random seats\" option. Me and my husband were able to sit together both times. Basically, just say \"no thanks\" to all the extras and you'll only pay for your flight.\n\nNow here's the bad stuff we dealt with. The plane was kind of dirty, e. g., headrests didn't appear to be cleaned after each flight, and the lap tables on the seat were super sticky and gross. Our plane to Denver was on time, but the return flight was delayed and we arrived an hour and a half late. No explanation was given by the Denver Spirit staff as to why the flight was delayed or when the ETA was. \n\nFinal Analysis: I would use Spirit Airlines again and would only recommend it to people who can travel light (1 backpack), are flying for short durations (under 3 hours), and do not have a connecting flight.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #195","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2015-07-21","useful":21,"counts":{"all":2,"selection":1,"just":3,"issued":1,"random":1,"thanks":1,"seats":1,"staff":1,"24":1,"tables":1,"$":7,"personal":2,"(":2,"backpack":3,"28":1,",":16,"denver":4,"actually":1,"late":1,"to":15,"only":3,"potential":1,"choose":1,"under":1,"fuel":1,"save":1,"recommended":1,"customer":1,"customers":1,"his":1,"return":1,"later":1,"get":2,"fyi":1,"cheaper":2,"early":1,"vegas":1,"they":2,"half":1,"not":1,"g.":1,"ticket":2,"now":1,"is":1,"tickets":2,"acquainted":1,"covering":1,"did":2,"53":1,"item":2,"bad":1,"stuff":1,"check-in":2,"dealt":1,"entitled":1,"steal":1,"husband":2,"because":1,"says":2,"people":2,"absolutely":1,"some":1,"seat":2,"one-way":1,"second":1,"expect":1,"pass":1,"our":1,"little":1,"will":1,"what":1,"appear":1,"for":3,"avoid":2,"per":1,"research":1,"3":1,"connecting":1,"boarding":1,"print":1,"got":1,"before":1,"can":2,"be":2,"we":3,"e.":1,"jansport":1,"given":1,"free":1,"hours":2,"here":1,"upfront":1,"invisible":1,"round-trip":3,"super":1,"by":2,"after":1,"both":1,"about":1,"of":3,"could":1,"36":2,"honest":1,"airport":3,"eta":1,"mccarran":1,"military":1,"or":3,"first":1,"co":1,"had":1,"each":1,"whatever":1,"airlines":4,"brought":2,"fees":1,"your":4,"use":1,"fee":1,"from":2,"would":2,"together":1,"flying":1,"charge":1,"least":1,".":20,"spirit":6,"195":1,"recommend":1,"headrests":1,":":3,"was":8,"final":1,"website":1,"``":4,"buy":1,"flight":7,"option":1,"on":3,"explanation":1,"co-worker":2,"delayed":2,"but":1,"2015":1,"basically":1,"prices":1,"sticky":1,"with":2,"than":1,"me":2,"10":1,"kind":1,"yelp":1,"hour":2,"cheapest":1,"these":1,"18":2,"challenge":1,"tip":1,"as":3,"n't":1,"'re":1,"dirty":1,"were":2,"my":4,"taking":1,"are":3,"and":11,"flights":1,"do":1,"pro":1,"in":1,"it":5,"an":1,"''":4,"say":1,"at":5,"have":1,"cleaned":1,"100":1,"airplane":1,"times":1,"if":1,"!":2,"again":1,"'ll":1,"able":1,"sit":1,")":2,"pay":1,"travel":1,"offer":1,"when":1,"1":2,"that":1,"book":1,"which":1,"online":2,"you":4,"aboard":1,"in-person":1,"'s":2,"gross":1,"durations":1,"who":1,"problems":1,"#":1,"plane":2,"arrived":1,"printed":1,"lap":1,"why":1,"las":1,"a":12,"short":1,"off":1,"third":1,"sizable":1,"i":2,"light":1,"no":4,"analysis":1,"person":1,"departs":1,"extras":1,"time":1,"the":16,"otherwise":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":5}

You have to read and research everything so you don't get stuck with additional fees. We were stressing out since the week prior to our flight there were so many cancelled flights. We were lucky and flew on time to PDX. We paid for one bag when we booked online otherwise it would have cost more later. Seats were additional to their base rate. My family of four brought backpacks which were free as a personal item. Be sure to check in at home and print tickets at home or you'll pay $10 per person. The line for bag drop was long. The spirit employees were OK overall, not the friendliest, but not rude either. Boarding the plane was somewhat hectic. They called assigned letter sections so quickly everyone just randomly cut into line. They called A then literally 30 seconds later called B, then the other sections 1-2 minutes between. We were C, but they called D so quickly that my kiddos got pushed aside with people waiting on the sides then sweeping in that we were almost last on the plane. The seats were plastic lined with a padded cover. Good for a short ride, but I couldn't handle a long plane ride. The steel tray table was small, maybe 1\/3 of a regular sized tray? It was fine for a drink and small snack. The flight was good and we made it on time.

I almost never see any other airlines under $300, and when I do, usually it's not non-stop.\n\nThe people who complain are often the ones who don't read the fine print and are \"shocked\" when they get charged $100 at the gate for a carry-on and say \"I'm never flying them again\".\n\nI know how their system works and take advantage of it.  I buy a big water and snacks and bring them on.  My wife and I pack all our stuff in one suitcase, check it, and pay one bag fee.

We live in miami and my friend and I decided to fly out of fort lauderdale because the price in spirit was about 80 bucks cheaper than american and thought it was worth the drive to save some money...Here is when things start to get interesting!!!! One day before travel Spirit sent me an email so I could check in in advance and save time at the airport which was perfectly fine, BUT when I tried to check in things start getting bad by every step of the check in process, First they tell you that if you don't check in advance you will get charged 10 dollars, then they hit you with no shame with an extra 40 dollars per bag for every leg of the trip, so we end up paying 80 dollar more that were not in the budget. Next day when we get to the airport we find out that they charge you 50 dollars more for carry on bags and there is no way around this, I witness more than 20 people complaining about getting ripped off at the gate, right before the board the plane, old people you name it, the just don't care and they wait to the last second to measure your bag and charge you right there when you have no time to do anything, if you don't pay you miss the flight. Then last but not least they treat you horrible, the people that work in this airline are trained to disrespect you in every possible way, of course there is some exceptions, but in general service is terrible.\nIn other words, if you go with SPIRIT you end up paying 258+40+40+50= 388$ + the drive to fort lauderdale from Miami + you get 0 cero snacks or drinks, VS my friends who traveled in American Airlines paid 327$ flu out of Miami, they got free checked bags, and free carry on bag and they got a snack and they were treated nice. So at the end you end up paying much more money for a horrible service, I don't know who manage this airline but certainly they make you feel like they just don't care an they can get your money anyway they want an make you feel stupid it is just not right they make you feel like they have permission or some kind of license to take your money away an nobody seems to do anything...

I would like to use this yelp review to propose a boycott of all spirit airlines flights. They do not deserve to exist as a legitimate company.\n\nLet me give you the lowdown on their behavior today. Three friends and I were flying out of Las Vegas to Oakland. They first delayed then cancelled our flight. They did not offer ANY ALTERNATIVE FLIGHTS on the same day. The next flight they offered- A FULL 36 HOURS LATER- did not include the cost of another night of accommodation. We had to spend the entire day racing around the airport looking for flights to go standby on. Eventually, the four of us flew back separately on different airlines to the San Francisco airport and had to commute to Oakland to retrieve our car. Overalls, Spirits' negligence cost us $1300 that they made no effort to reimburse us for. \n\nThroughout this entire process, Sprit offered us no assistance. They left us completely stranded and alone in Las Vegas.  I have never been so disgusted by a company as I was with Spirit Airlines. They should burn for what they did to us.

Delays are the main Issue.  Last year our trip to Vegas flying out of Oakland airport was delayed for over 6 hours. Customer service was not so great as they did not keep us informed of anything.\n\nWell lucky me, we decided to give them another chance and flew with them again this year. Our departure from Oakland to Vegas went smooth and on time but going home was another story. I received an email Monday morning saying the flight was delayed until 2:30 pm (Original departure time 11:59 am)...I said oh well i won't mind a couple hours.... and then hour later another email saying the flight has been delayed until the next day. What??? huh??  I decided to call customer service and was on the line for 30 mins, no one answer, this was at 8:00 am. I was confused because online, it still says it was on time. Couldn't get a hold of anyone to give me a straight answer...so..we went to the airport to confirm. When I got to the airport, I received an email saying the flight is back on time. Now I'm really confused delay...delay even more....back on time?? \nI walk up to the counter and ask the staff, if our flight was on time, and she confirms it is. I'm thinking to myself glad I came to the airport. Thought went away very fast as 2 mins later I find out it is cancelled and next flight out was the next day!!!\n\nLong story short, its not WORTH THE HEADACHE to save a couple bucks.  Trust me, I read the reviews below and never thought it would happen to me but it did.  I flew with them twice and will NEVER do so again. I don't know how this airlines stays running but I guess its fools like me that will give them another try thinking a different result.

They waited for the plane to leave Chicago and be on its way to Las Vegas to cancel our flight - after making us wait three hours and making sure the last southwest flight had just left.  And then told us the next flight was Monday. Today is Saturday.\n\nAnd why did they cancel our flight? Because they had no crew to fly it due to the delay.  The plane is here, but this airlines is so misorganized and small, they don't have a crew.  So this will cost us at least $200 for a hotel or a car rental and we lose a day.  \n\nI am never flying spirit again.\n[\/edit]\n\nSo far, I love this airline.\nOnce you realize everything is \u00e0 la carte and plan accordingly, you'll be fine.\n\nWe flew to Vegas - I had a backpack & my purse  and he had a small duffel bag, which were just fine for four days in Vegas and those are free to take onboard with you.  I had to pay $10 to pick seats because I wanted to sit next to my baby. Nothing is free on the flight (including water) and there is no entertainment.\n\nThe seats were comfortable and the plane was clean.  The staff was professional and friendly.\n\nI'm sure people love to bitch that they are being nickled and dimed for everything, but that's the whole point - you pay the cheapest rate possible for a seat on a plane and then only pay for what you need and want.

When the way most suitcases are set up if you pack it full it weighs 50lb. Also 50lb is the limit for all other airlines. So we get there and the weigh our bag and it is 50lbs.

So I tried again thinking that I may have entered my numbers incorrectly. On my second attempt, my transaction went through. A few days later I see two charges on my bank card for the same exact amount! The first & second transactions both ended up getting processed onto my account. When I called Spirit Airlines they said they only have one reservation booked under my name, therefore they refused to refund me the first transaction since they have no record of it on their end. I finally called Citibank to dispute one of my charges & they were nice enough to reverse the fraudulent charge.\n\nYesterday I logged back onto the Spirit Airlines website to pay for my luggages prior to my upcoming flight. Again, my transaction could not be processed & the website froze on me. I did a second attempt and the website informed me that my transaction could not be processed. I immediately checked my bank account and it shows I have TWO of the same exact charges from Spirit Airlines AGAIN even though both transactions \"could not be processed\"! Spirit Airlines is singing the same tune again saying they have no record of any transactions & refuse to refund me these fraudulent charges!\n\nI ended up Google-ing the company & I have found endless complaints of the same exact \"ghost transactions\" from Spirit Airlines (I suppose that's how they came up\nwith the name \"Spirit\" Airlines). There are also many complaints towards Spirit Airlines canceling flights at the last minute & refusing to refund money to any of the passengers. There's a community of people who are asking the government & The Department of Travel demanding a company shut down of Spirit Airlines. \n\nSpirit Airlines is the WORST airline ever!

Oh, yes, I remember now... because they're cheap AF and you get what you pay for! \n\nYou pay nothing = you get absolutely NOTHING. \n\nA seat that reclines would be nice. A cup of water would be nice. Hell, even if they threw in an ice cube or two, that'd also be nice. But I'm sure an ice cube would be asking entirely too much of Spirit. \n\nPay extra for baggage. Pay extra for a carry on. Pay extra to pick your seat... You'd think if you're paying to pick your shitty seat that said shitty seat would enable you some level of comfort? Nah. I'm barely over 5 feet tall and had the worst cramps in my legs and neck from sitting at a 90 degree angle for 4 hours. I don't know how the people who are taller than me manage a flight like this. Awful. \n\nThere was one slight (and I mean slight) positive note. Spirit is now offering free baggage for military. We prepaid our bags months ago (because if you prepay it's cheaper than if you do it at the counter... nickel and dime everything!). We went to check in and the gate agent informed us of the updated policy after seeing my husband's military ID. He immediately refunded us the checked and carry on baggage $$$. That was awesome.

I read all their rules, fees, and guidelines and figured I'd give them a shot. I thought that this may be do-able for a quick little weekend getaway.\n\nI made our reservations for a little weekend trip to another state. The fares are astoundingly low. They are upfront bout letting you know that the price only includes the seat and the gas for the plane. But even after choosing certain options, our tickets were still fairly low, so we bought the tickets.\n\nWell, here it is, roughly 12 hours before our departure time and the flight has been cancelled! Very disappointing! So I call Spirit to find out about refunds on cancellations. The recording say to take care of it online or you will (wait for it) be charged a fee. Well, I go online and they will not refund your money. They will only issue you a credit....and that credit is only good for 60 days! What if I'm not traveling in the next 60 days?? \n\nWell, after 1 hour and 23 minutes on hold, I finally had a chance to speak to a Spirit representative. At first, they tried to get me to take a 60 day credit, but, after some \"spirited conversation\" (see what I did there?) , they agreed to refund me my money. There was no attempt to offer a different flight or make some other arrangements. I understand they can't control the weather, but I just feel like more of an effort could have been made to come to a more satisfying resolution.\n\nI am at least happy to get my refund. I may even attempt to use them again one day. They are still better than United lol\n\nBut for now it is still..\n\n2 stars.\n\nI have experienced better.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":2,"date":"2016-04-17","useful":18,"counts":{"refund":3,"all":1,"shot":1,"just":1,"money":2,"agreed":1,"go":1,"still":2,"find":1,"before":1,"letting":1,"23":1,"(":2,"had":1,",":15,"spirit":2,"better":2,"to":13,"only":3,"fares":1,"has":1,"...":1,"them":2,"good":1,"get":2,"very":1,"made":2,"know":1,"they":7,"despite":1,"not":2,"now":1,"day":2,"tickets":2,"bout":1,"like":1,"did":1,".and":1,"quick":1,"fairly":1,"guidelines":1,"some":2,"seat":1,"see":1,"been":2,"are":3,"choosing":1,"our":3,"out":1,"even":2,"recording":1,"what":2,"satisfying":1,"for":6,"state":1,"issue":1,"?":3,"bought":1,"be":2,"we":1,"after":3,"departure":1,"little":2,"here":1,"hours":1,"rules":1,"upfront":1,"astoundingly":1,"come":1,"care":1,"on":2,"about":1,"figured":1,"of":2,"could":2,"days":2,"credit":3,"'d":1,"still..":1,"options":1,"first":1,"and":6,"feel":1,"ca":1,"one":1,"60":3,"weather":1,"lol":1,"another":1,"fees":1,".":18,"your":1,"speak":1,"use":1,"fee":1,"there":2,"finally":1,"least":1,"next":1,"their":1,"2":1,"call":1,"low":2,"stars":1,"reservations":1,"wait":1,"was":1,"more":2,"``":1,"flight":2,"that":3,"gas":1,"but":4,"understand":1,"representative":1,"hold":1,"effort":1,"than":1,"me":2,"disappointing":1,"12":1,"hour":1,"this":2,"work":1,"getaway":1,"will":3,"reviews":1,"were":1,"cancelled":1,"happy":1,"minutes":1,"traveling":1,"control":1,"give":1,"certain":1,"is":3,"am":1,"it":4,"an":1,"''":1,"n't":1,"say":1,"arrangements":1,"at":2,"have":2,"in":1,"my":2,"trip":1,"if":1,"!":3,"again":1,"different":1,"united":1,"conversation":1,")":2,"make":2,"offer":1,"1":1,"read":1,"other":1,"take":2,"online":2,"you":3,"spirited":1,"experienced":1,"tried":1,"may":2,"price":1,"do-able":1,"includes":1,"chance":1,"plane":1,"cancellations":1,"'m":1,"weekend":2,"a":10,"attempt":2,"refunds":1,"i":16,"no":1,"well":3,"roughly":1,"or":2,"thought":2,"so":2,"time":1,"the":11,"resolution":1,"charged":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":14}

guys are probably the worst airline I have ever experience. I went through Spirit Airlines a couple of times. The first time, I was heading out to Vegas to visit my parents. At first, I thought, 'hey, cheap airline, can't complain'. (Keep in mind, this is my first flight). My first experience was pretty intense, not gonna lie. I was hungover the night before, almost missed my flight, but luckily the pilot was nice enough to wait for me to board. The ride was kind of rocky, but that was due to turbulence so you cant really control the air on a windy day. Overall experience; 7\/10.  \n\n\nMy second flight with Spirit was amazing. I was flying from San Diego to Vegas, again. Everyone in the plane was extremely nice, the flight attendants were super cool, and everyone who board that week was in a good mood. The plane ride was smooth. I had window seat so the view was absolutely beautiful. Overall experience; 10\/10. \n\n\nMy most recent flight was Thurs (11\/20-23). Las Vegas to San Diego. Oh, dear lord. I've had a couple of friends ask me how your airlines work, and how i'm able to be a satisfied customer flying with you guys. Of course, as a regular, I took offense and backed up Spirit by giving out positive feedbacks. Yes, the fares are low, and they charge for second carry-on or check-in bags. But, it gets you from where you want to be under $200, instead of $400 last minute. A close friend of mine noticed on some online reviews, some guest were told their flight got delayed and were told to come back in two hours, but later finding out their flight left them within that period of waiting to be boarded. I thought to myself that has never happened to me, and you can also purchase a Emergency Notification Text in case a situation were to happen like that. \n\nWell. Let me tell you. \n\nThursday, I had purchase that stupid Notification Text\/ Message just in case my flight were to change. i was running pretty late, not so late where I missed my flight but my schedule was behind so I knew by the time I got there my flight was boarding. I check-in with front agents, and print my ticket with them as well. The lady looks at my ticket, and tells me my flight is boarding I need to get there ASAP. I kindly take the ticket from her hand and see \"12:48 PM\" Boarding Time. I rush to the gates letting the security know my flights about to take off. The let me cut-in line, after TSA, I book my way towards B25. I probably ran half a mile under 1 minute with carry-on bag on me. Once i got to the gate, the TV screen says, \"1:37 OAKLAND\". At that moment, I felt like my flight left me. I got mad at myself knowing it was my fault for running late, and not being at the airport at the appropriate time. \n\nI went to go talk to the Spirit Customer Service, asked the lady for help, and she looks up, and gives me a stare. Like, okay, as if your jobs that hard. I asked her a simple question if Vegas to San Diego left. She gives me a stare like I was the last one to know, with her bitchy attitude her response, \"Your flight got pushed back two hours ago, *smirk face, hands back ticket* Something happened Baltimore\", I tell her that my parents always, always purchase that stupid $14 bulshit just in case something happens, lady tells me there's no such thing, show her my itinerary. The reaction on her face was absolutely priceless, waiting for her to open her mouth she tells me \"they notified everyone\". I stare her for the longest time like you just said there was no such thing, and suddenly there is. To add on, I asked her if the check-in agents knew about the flights being delayed, and she tells me 'yes, everyone boarding this flight to SD should be aware when they check-in, it was delayed'. I checked my email twice, and asked my parents if they got a email, and they said \"No\". \n\nSeriously? Your guys staff is terrible. You guys should be embarrassed with the team you guys have. Im sorry scanning a ticket, and making sure people's baggage is up to par is SO, SO hard. Im sure a 5 year old can do a better job than your Vegas Staff.

Like other reviewers have said, you need to prepare yourself for a flight, otherwise you WILL be caught by surprise by hidden fees. The key to this is reading their contract of carriage. Yes, it's like 900+ pages, but be aware of the fees and charges and you can indeed get a very cheap flight with them. \n\nI have flown back and forth a few times from Boston to Myrtle Beach for as little as $90 for my wife and myself. More typically, we do check a single bag, and end up paying around $160 or so RT for the two of us. \n\nWe let the airline select our seat (it's an hour and a half flight, who cares?) and make sure to print boarding passes ahead of time. My wife and I have never not sat next to each other even with assigned seats. Double check your carry on items fit into the small personal item container. And you are OK. \n\nYet, every single time I fly I see someone at the gate freaking out over a $40 checked bag fee. While I do feel bad that they were surprised by these costs, they aren't hidden. \n\nFinally; don't make any assumptions about what is free or not on Spirit Airlines. I wouldn't be surprised if they hooked up a mask to you to measure how much oxygen you use and charge for that. They key is research and making sure you are aware of what those fees are. \n\nChances are, once you calculated it all out, you will still save a ton of money vs. flying another airline. It's just more of an aggravation to get there. \n\nPros: Cheapest flights around, even after fees, if you plan for it. \nCons: Requires hours of research to ensure you don't get charged extra for things; flights are often delayed or late.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2012-08-12","useful":4,"counts":{"all":1,"just":1,"chances":1,"indeed":1,"over":1,"cheap":1,"assigned":1,"seats":1,"yes":1,"still":1,"yet":1,"ok.":1,"$":3,"fit":1,"personal":1,"(":1,",":13,"late":1,"to":9,"finally":1,"reviewers":1,"hidden":2,"save":1,"surprised":2,"do":4,"them":1,"someone":1,"around":2,"get":3,"very":1,"every":1,"they":4,"half":1,"not":2,"items":1,"freaking":1,"like":2,"oxygen":1,"item":1,"bad":1,"each":1,"small":1,"often":1,"back":1,"seat":1,"see":1,"are":6,"measure":1,"our":1,"myrtle":1,"out":2,"rt":1,"will":2,"what":2,"said":1,"container":1,"for":7,"bag":2,"hooked":1,"aggravation":1,"research":2,"print":1,"surprise":1,";":2,"reading":1,"forth":1,"?":1,"be":3,"we":2,"who":1,"never":1,"900+":1,"little":1,"free":1,"hours":1,"let":1,"key":2,"from":1,"by":3,"vs.":1,"on":2,"about":1,"ok":1,"prepare":1,"ahead":1,"of":8,"contract":1,"times":1,"ensure":1,"airline":2,"160":1,"or":3,"otherwise":1,"flying":1,"extra":1,"feel":1,"into":1,"yourself":1,"another":1,"fees":4,"carry":1,".":18,"your":1,"select":1,"passes":1,"use":1,"fee":1,"checked":1,"would":1,"cares":1,"caught":1,"there":1,"two":1,"next":1,"their":1,"much":1,"ton":1,":":2,"more":2,"flight":3,"that":2,"delayed":1,"but":1,"aware":2,"90":1,"with":2,"spirit":2,"those":1,"paying":1,"boarding":1,"myself":1,"hour":1,"cheapest":1,"this":1,"double":1,"up":2,"us":1,"n't":4,"i":6,"while":1,"can":1,"were":1,"making":1,"my":2,"flights":2,"and":11,"carriage":1,"cons":1,"money":1,"boston":1,"is":4,"few":1,"an":2,"fly":1,"as":2,"assumptions":1,"at":1,"have":3,"need":1,"check":2,"sat":1,"these":1,"end":1,")":1,"things":1,"make":2,"40":1,"any":1,"how":1,"other":2,"airlines":1,"gate":1,"you":11,"if":2,"beach":1,"even":2,"sure":2,"'s":3,"it":5,"after":1,"charge":1,"flown":1,"plan":1,"pages":1,"single":2,"a":8,"pros":1,"wife":2,"charges":1,"typically":1,"calculated":1,"mask":1,"costs":1,"so":1,"time":2,"the":6,"once":1,"requires":1,"charged":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

I have flown spirit a couple of times, so I know to pack light, expect  little in-flight service and less leg room, etc. This last time was bad, though. I was supposed to take a red-eye from Las Vegas to DC with a connection in Atlanta. When I went to check into my flight online, I noticed that the first leg was delayed enough that I would not be able to make the connection. I immediately got on the phone with customer service and was assured that I would not miss my connecting flight, despite the math of the departure times, because the flight would not depart without me on it. After trying to get a more logical explanation, I was again promised that I would not be left stranded in Atlanta! On my way to the airport I called again to confirm that the flight was still delayed and could not get a straight answer from the agent no matter how many times I asked. It went like this - me: \"What time does my flight leave Las Vegas?\" Agent: \"That's a great question! Let me check...\" repeated several times with a different departure time each time I asked! Finally, I was told that the flight would be leaving in 10 minutes and that I should be there 3 hours before departure - clearly impossible. When I pointed this out, she responded with, \"That's a great point. Let me check....\" When I got to the airport, I was told that I had been reassigned to an earlier flight, which I had missed, and the next possible flight was tomorrow. Since I had not been informed of the change, at least they did not require me to pay to reschedule. Back in the car for another four hour round trip....

was my first experience with Spirit, but considering all of the ragey reviews, I thought I'd share my pennies. \n\nFirst of all: Fees. Yes, Spirit charges them. This can be very tricksy if you're booking through a third party site as you get the standard \"please check policies and fees\" message. You see, Spirit provides an a la carte flight experience. This way, you only pay for what you use. Spirit's website is very detailed and transparent about what they charge, you should definitely take a peek. But here are the biggest gripes I hear that people have come accustomed to on other carriers that Spirit \"surprisingly nickels and dimes\" ya- again, not a surprise if you take a minute to look.\n\nTicket\/Seats:The ticket purchase only pays for your ticket and tax and you get to bring one personal item (about the size of a small backpack) onto the plane. If you want to choose seats (which you MUST do if you would like a seat next to your travel companion or if you prefer a specific spot on the plane- aisle, window, front, back), there will be a fee. Like most airlines, seats with extra legroom are higher in price.\n\nBags: ALL bags are charged fees, whether it's a carry on (in addition to your personal item) or checked. There are several weight tiers for checked bags. NOTE: Most airlines do not consider a bag to be \"overweight\" until the 50lb mark. Spirit considers a bag over 40lbs \"overweight\" and the fee goes up dramatically if it's heavier (check the website for rates). The bag fee is lowest if you purchase it during the ticket purchase (I booked through a third party site, so the added bag was not available at this time. It would probably be best to book straight through Spirit.com). If you are unable to purchase your bag at ticket purchase, it is still wise to purchase ASAP. Waiting until you are at the airport is going to cost ya. \n\nChecking In: It is recommended to check-in online and print your boarding pass from home\/hotel. However, if that is impossible, you may check-in and print at the airport kiosk, but that will set you back another $10 each way.\n\nIn-Flight: All snacks and beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic alike, even water) must be purchased. There are no screens, radios, or movies on the plane, so if you need some munchies or entertainment, you should absolutely bring your own. \n\nOkay, so I think that pretty much covers fees. \n\nI will admit, I was a little apprehensive considering the stigma of Spirit, it didn't last long, though.\n\nI fly frequently enough to have experienced several airlines and it has been quite a while since I have had a flight leave on time (less than 15 mins late). My Spirit flight was not only on time, but early! Because fewer people had carry-ons, it took less time to board and get everyone settled. We were wheels up in no time! \n\nThe plane was average, if not cleaner and more comfortable than most other competitors. A lot of people are bummed that the seats don't recline, but as a person with long-ish legs, I LOVE that the person in front of me can't smash their seat into my knee caps. \n\nThe flight back was a 2-legger. When I gave the agent my bag, she made a comment that I \"wouldn't need to worry about my bag between flights\". It turned out that my plane was trekking both legs of my trip with a stop on the way so my bag didn't need to change planes. I wonder if a plane change requires fliers to hand carry their own bags between planes? \n\nOnce again, we were wheels up on time. \n\nThis plane had maybe just a slight bit less legroom than my first trip, but it wasn't any tighter than any other airline's planes. \n\nService, for the most part, was superb. Agents and flight attendants were all friendly and eager to help. There were a few off-putting moments by the staff at the gate during the layover, but they were bearable. \n\nOverall, the experience was well above average. While it might not be my favorite airline, I would absolutely fly Spirit again.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":4,"date":"2016-11-20","useful":5,"counts":{"all":5,"think":1,"consider":1,"radios":1,"less":3,"moments":1,"pennies":1,"over":1,"people":3,"other":3,"bring":2,"mark":1,"through":3,"higher":1,"seats":3,"yes":1,"still":1,"bit":1,"50lb":1,"bummed":1,"$":1,"took":1,"la":1,"personal":2,"(":7,"backpack":1,"had":3,",":40,"should":2,"late":1,"to":18,"charge":1,"going":1,"choose":1,"pretty":1,"ticket\/seats":1,"might":1,"dramatically":1,"gave":1,"do":3,"them":1,"nickels":1,"above":1,"get":3,"very":2,"prefer":1,"home\/hotel":1,"slight":1,"caps":1,"early":1,"me":1,"were":5,"window":1,"wise":1,"they":2,"surprise":1,"not":6,"during":2,"ticket":4,"added":1,"transparent":1,"minute":1,"smash":1,"and":15,"like":2,"did":2,"munchies":1,"fewer":1,"specific":1,"item":2,"check-in":2,"booking":1,"have":3,"each":1,"small":1,"front":2,"carry-ons":1,"help":1,"dimes":1,"few":1,"set":1,"weight":1,"peek":1,"absolutely":2,"some":1,"back":3,"seat":2,"see":1,"cost":1,"ragey":1,"layover":1,"stigma":1,"best":1,"out":1,"even":1,"will":3,"what":2,"snacks":1,"charges":1,"for":5,"bag":8,"lowest":1,"since":1,"please":1,"superb":1,"waiting":1,"unable":1,"heavier":1,"in-flight":1,"goes":1,"between":2,"print":2,"probably":1,"tricksy":1,"staff":1,"carte":1,"she":1,"available":1,"be":6,"we":2,"beverages":1,"asap":1,"spot":1,"planes":3,"however":1,"here":1,"provides":1,"water":1,"no":2,"checked":2,"standard":1,"come":1,"by":1,"change":2,"both":1,"about":3,"last":1,"would":4,"fliers":1,"of":7,"just":1,"favorite":1,"experience":3,"airport":2,"'d":1,"airline":2,"party":2,"enough":1,"spirit.com":1,"quite":1,"wheels":2,"onto":1,"or":4,"bearable":1,"first":3,"comment":1,"this":5,"own":2,"love":1,"extra":1,"pays":1,"into":1,"?":1,"apprehensive":1,"40lbs":1,"one":1,"screens":1,"everyone":1,"agents":1,"been":1,"another":1,"fees":4,"carry":2,"impossible":1,"message":1,".":39,"considers":1,"size":1,"considering":2,"has":1,"little":1,"fee":3,"from":1,"service":1,"eager":1,"addition":1,"plane-":1,"there":4,"ya":1,"airlines":3,"long":1,"next":1,"spirit":9,"their":2,"much":1,"rates":1,"way":3,"time":6,"biggest":1,"legs":2,"was":10,"until":2,"board":1,"website":2,"a":24,"``":5,"only":3,"flight":5,"lot":1,"aisle":1,"tax":1,"attendants":1,"kiosk":1,"tiers":1,"but":7,"surprisingly":1,"off-putting":1,"bags":4,"part":1,"because":1,"covers":1,"companion":1,"an":1,"with":4,"than":4,"must":2,"fly":2,"boarding":1,"frequently":1,"made":1,"15":1,"look":1,"'s":4,"whether":1,"leave":1,"straight":1,"up":3,"friendly":1,"ya-":1,"reviews":1,"while":2,"'re":1,"accustomed":1,"can":1,"policies":1,"trekking":1,"site":2,"more":1,"my":11,"are":8,"detailed":1,"cleaner":1,"stop":1,"flights":1,"non-alcoholic":1,"alcoholic":1,"is":6,"pass":1,"turned":1,"it":12,"agent":1,"comfortable":1,"''":5,"n't":6,"as":2,"alike":1,"purchased":1,"in":5,"need":3,"legroom":2,"mins":1,"movies":1,"any":2,"worry":1,"if":12,"!":2,"again":3,"long-ish":1,"want":1,"carriers":1,")":7,":":6,"ca":1,"that":9,"when":1,"admit":1,"check":2,"note":1,"checking":1,"recommended":1,"book":1,"take":2,"which":1,"online":1,"gate":1,"you":19,"several":2,"recline":1,"10":1,"trip":2,"experienced":1,"okay":1,"though":1,"may":1,"overall":1,"price":1,"use":1,"overweight":2,"hand":1,"2-legger":1,"plane":6,"wonder":1,"gripes":1,"share":1,"knee":1,"on":8,"the":28,"tighter":1,"your":6,"purchase":6,"booked":1,"third":2,"i":14,"maybe":1,"average":2,"entertainment":1,"well":1,"settled":1,"thought":1,"person":2,"competitors":1,"definitely":1,"so":4,"pay":1,"at":5,"hear":1,"most":4,"charged":1,"requires":1,"travel":1,"once":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":2}

As a $9 fare club member, one would assume that there would be exemptions from such nickle-and-dime policies, but no, they apply to everyone. The poor and broken quality of the planes was of great concern- seats with rips in the fabric, tray tables with broken locks, and light fixtures that snap off if you try to adjust the angle. It makes customers concerned about the safety of the aircraft if these basic items cannot be maintained. The level of service on board was laughable-  our first flight had less than a quarter of the listed beverage options available for purchase and the last one would only take exact change because the credit card reader was disabled. First world problems, I know, but Spirit shouldn't offer the service if it cannot keep up with the demand. Also, the planes we flew on were not thoroughly cleaned after the previous passengers disembarked - trash, gum, and tissues were some of the things I noted. The flight attendants were generally pleasant, but most were more concerned with napping or reading their novels than making rounds to check on passengers. Our flights on the return trip were heavily delayed and, between the two flights, we spent over and hour and a half sitting on the termac post-landing as Spirit had no other gates available at Chicago O'Hare and Las Vegas International. This meant a trip that should have taken roughly 9 hours took about 13. On top of that, the email alerts updating passengers on delays and gate changes were not timely. We almost missed our return connection because an email said it would leave at 10:50 pm. Luckily we walked to the gate early and were informed it was leaving at 10:25 instead and from a different gate than what we were told. My husband and I both prefer to fly at a bargain rate, but these conditions made out recent experience deplorable. If we have other options within our means in the future, I highly doubt we will choose to fly Spirit ever again.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2014-07-17","useful":0,"counts":{"gates":1,"less":1,"-":1,"over":1,"disabled":1,"10:50":1,"delays":1,"seats":1,"fixtures":1,"its":1,"previous":1,"one":2,"tables":1,"$":2,"also":1,"with":4,"concerned":2,"heavily":1,"had":2,",":17,"should":2,"to":7,"o'hare":1,"choose":1,"snap":1,"meant":1,"do":1,"customers":2,"return":2,"aparently":1,"sitting":1,"reader":1,"flew":1,"early":1,"vegas":1,"know":1,"they":1,"half":1,"not":5,"world":1,"now":1,"exact":1,"timely":1,"level":1,"ever":1,"gum":1,"leave":1,"these":2,"adjust":1,"quarter":1,"deplorable":1,"noted":1,"exemptions":1,"poor":1,"everyone":1,"some":1,"light":1,"up":1,"items":1,"rate":1,"our":4,"out":1,"try":1,"what":1,"said":1,"missed":1,"for":1,"chicago":1,"charges":1,"concern-":1,"safety":1,"between":1,"print":1,"international":1,"reading":1,"conditions":1,"email":2,"told":1,"available":2,"be":2,"we":7,"planes":2,"pleasant":1,"broken":2,"aircraft":1,"change":1,"passengers":3,"about":2,"last":1,"would":4,"nickle-and-dime":1,"tray":1,"hours":1,"experience":1,"keep":1,"credit":1,"connection":1,"husband":1,"advance":1,"changes":1,"options":2,"first":2,"spent":1,"within":1,"prefer":1,"highly":1,"pm":1,"maintained":1,"because":2,"offer":1,"apply":1,"quality":1,"rounds":1,"laughable-":1,"passes":1,"most":1,"fee":1,"from":2,"fabric":1,"service":2,"their":2,"top":1,"there":1,"informed":1,"only":1,".":15,"start":1,"doubt":1,"listed":1,"basic":1,"taken":1,"means":1,"las":1,"was":4,"board":1,"attendants":1,"flight":2,"both":1,"club":1,"great":1,"spirit":4,"took":1,"but":4,"disembarked":1,"luckily":1,"demand":1,"off":2,"card":1,"termac":1,"than":3,"updating":1,"fly":2,"boarding":1,"13":1,"made":1,"hour":1,"locks":1,"this":1,"bargain":1,"will":1,"assume":1,"future":1,"can":2,"policies":1,"were":8,"making":1,"more":1,"my":1,"and":13,"instead":1,"flights":2,"almost":1,"of":7,"tissues":1,"it":4,"an":1,"rips":1,"n't":1,"as":2,"at":4,"have":2,"cleaned":1,"leaving":1,"check":2,"if":5,"again":1,"different":1,"angle":1,"no":2,"thoroughly":1,"alerts":1,"generally":1,"trip":2,"member":1,"post-landing":1,"that":4,"other":2,"take":1,"9":2,"gate":3,"you":1,"trash":1,"10":1,"fare":1,"novels":1,"after":1,"problems":1,"delayed":1,"10:25":1,"two":1,"such":1,"on":7,"recent":1,"a":7,"purchase":1,"in":4,"i":4,"makes":1,"napping":1,"roughly":1,"walked":1,"or":1,"beverage":1,"things":1,"the":22},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

I have flown on Spirit Airlines once and that's all it took. There was a 2 1\/2 hour delay departing and there was no communication or warning as we checked before we left our house to make sure our flight was on time. When we got there there was no plane at our terminal where it was supposed to be and no representative to inform anyone. We were left guessing. Finally when a representative showed up we were informed the flight was delayed since its morning flight. The FAA fines airlines for late departures and delays and these people do everything they can to avoid it like marking a flight as on time or better yet, on our return trip there was an hour delay and 30 minutes prior to boarding the plane I checked the status and it was marked as departed. Even in the airport before we left, the flight board had our exact flight marked as departed. Someone told me they don't have leases on the terminals like the major airlines do. This results in a \"land when its convenient for the airport\" type of agreement. The seats were much smaller than other airlines. I am 6'3 and my head towered over the head rest and my knees were cramped the whole flight. As well, the interior of the plane was absolutely disgusting! there was a moldy mess in the seat back pocket in front of me and I couldn't even use it. We even had to wait an hour to get our luggage from the carousel. In short, if you have a lot of time to waste and want a cheap flight on a dirty plane this airline is for you. To their credit the airplane itself seamed very mechanically sound with very smooth take offs and and landings.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2013-08-29","useful":0,"counts":{"all":1,"departed":2,"departing":1,"over":1,"cheap":1,"results":1,"rest":1,"front":1,"showed":1,"seats":1,"its":2,"before":2,"leases":1,"exact":1,"delays":3,"had":2,",":5,"spirit":3,"terminal":1,"to":10,"finally":1,"board":1,"dirty":1,"fines":1,"do":3,"someone":1,"return":1,"get":1,"very":2,"pocket":1,"they":2,"supposed":1,"awful":1,"2":1,"faa":1,"unethical":1,"landings":1,"like":2,"towered":1,"morning":1,"these":1,"where":1,"6'3":1,"guessing":1,"smaller":1,"people":1,"absolutely":1,"house":1,"back":1,"lot":1,"seat":1,"expect":1,"our":6,"even":3,"knees":1,"mechanically":1,"for":3,"cleanliness":1,"god":1,"avoid":1,"since":1,"yet":1,"everything":1,"moldy":1,"got":1,"told":1,"be":1,"we":7,"unprofessional":1,"were":4,"agreement":1,"terminals":1,"flyer":1,"departures":1,"from":2,"wait":1,"on":7,"luggage":1,"of":5,"could":1,"30":1,"prior":1,"airport":2,"flown":1,"airline":2,"whole":1,"or":2,"major":3,"there":6,"communication":1,"marked":2,"disgusting":1,"late":1,"use":1,"checked":2,"flying":1,"informed":1,"airlines":5,".":16,"anyone":1,"their":1,"much":1,"seasoned":1,"carousel":1,"waste":1,"was":10,"head":2,"flight":8,"1\/2":1,"that":1,"offs":1,"delayed":1,"it":5,"land":1,"representative":2,"unsanitary":1,"with":1,"than":1,"me":2,"boarding":1,"hour":3,"this":2,"type":1,"smooth":1,"up":1,"n't":2,"warning":1,"can":1,"planes":1,"minutes":1,"and":15,"have":3,"is":2,"am":2,"``":1,"an":2,"''":1,"as":5,"itself":1,"at":1,"want":1,"in":5,"my":2,"airplane":1,"trip":1,"if":2,"!":2,"marking":1,"credit":1,"convenient":1,"make":1,"when":3,"delay":2,"sound":1,"other":1,"take":1,"better":1,"interior":1,"you":3,"status":1,"sure":1,"'s":1,"mess":1,"took":1,"most":1,"plane":5,"plan":1,"seamed":1,"a":9,"short":1,"i":5,"no":3,"well":1,"inform":1,"cramped":1,"time":3,"the":21,"left":3,"once":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

WORST EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE!!\n\nWho is not surprised to read yet another horrific review of Spirit Airline!?!?!\nMy new nickname for them is the \"Golden Coral of the sky\" Because much like Golden Coral they entice you with a good price then by the time you leave your still hungry, sick to your stomach and never want to even see their name again because it angers you so dam much. I've also made up a new slogan (Ok I didnt make this one up, one of the many angry passengers uttered it and I stole it) Spirit airline, We will get your spirit to your destination.... they rest, your on your own! has a ring to it no? \n\nStuartist - Rude, obnoxious and pushy. My experience had me wanting to jump off the plane. this girl thought she could talk down to all the people on our plane. I should have gotten her name (11\/13\/16 from Cancun to Ft.Lauderdale) . Our plane was late and everyone on the plane was worried about missing their connecting flights. Over the load speaker they mentioned flights that needed to get off the plane first (Because the pilot and stuartist had these flights)and everyone else should wait on the plane. So I asked her what about the atlantic city flight? I already knew it was cutting it close because boarding time was 15 minutes away and we had not even landed yet. The Stuartist got loud with me and said \"Didn't you listen to anything I just said? If you where listening you would already know that you should be fine to catch your flight\". All lies!!! They also went out of their way to push their Spirit airlines credit card in everyones faces over and over again. You'll know who i am talking about when you see her\/him. It is about 6 ft tall, short blond hair, mans face & jaw with a scarf tied around his adams apple!\n\nPilot - I give the pilot any kudos I can because she took off and landed really well. other than that she didnt say or do much so..... I wouldn't blame the pilot for leaving the gate late although she did blame it on waiting for gas which seems fishy since that seems to be Spirits GO TO answer every time they run behind schedule.\n\nCheck in\/Rescheduling desk - They were very understaffed, myself along with hundreds of Spirits now ex customers sat in hours of crazy long lines over and over again had ZERO answers to give any of us. They left us stranded at an airport for what seemed like forever with no food or water, no bed or hotel, no transportation.  Just a big Grin knowing they already had our money! \n\nDesk Clerk Manager - Biggest Wuss Afraid for his life with good cause. This guy was no help to me, any Spirit customers and im sure not to his wife either. When he crawled out from the rock he was under because  he heard people screaming had ZERO to offer. I know why he had such a blank look on his face... He does this everyday. Day in and day out he is a front-man for Spirit as a professional scum bag. I hope they pay him well. He was well versed in the \"i dont knows\" that Spirit is well known for. The only thing he had to offer was a bench to sleep on next to some bum who snored loud and shouted obscenities in his sleep. \n\nTO THE CEO, CFO and whoever else is profiting from this insult of the air should be ashamed of themselves!!!","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2016-11-15","useful":1,"counts":{"wanting":1,"all":2,"listening":1,"just":2,"versed":1,"ceo":1,"money":1,"over":5,"rest":1,"catch":1,"manager":1,"own":1,"sleep":2,"mentioned":1,"still":1,"fine":1,"yet":2,"seemed":1,"also":2,"(":3,"whoever":1,"seems":2,",":12,"should":4,"late":2,"to":22,"flights":3,"my":3,"under":1,"11\/13\/16":1,"has":1,"hope":1,"?":5,"then":1,"them":1,"good":2,"her\/him":1,"around":1,"get":2,"food":1,"dam":1,"adams":1,"cutting":1,"worst":1,"know":3,"they":9,"desk":2,"not":3,"slogan":1,"now":1,"screaming":1,"day":2,"grin":1,"like":2,"well":4,"angers":1,"shouted":1,"name":2,"did":2,"crawled":1,"'ve":1,"leave":1,"bag":1,"she":4,"entice":1,"rock":1,"zero":2,"bench":1,"went":1,"where":1,"cfo":1,"because":6,"people":2,"pushy":1,"ft.lauderdale":1,"some":1,"him":1,"jump":1,"go":1,"see":2,"ex":1,"our":3,"girl":1,"worried":1,"out":3,"even":2,"will":1,"what":2,"said":2,"spirits":2,"for":7,"waiting":1,"review":1,"since":1,"everyones":1,"behind":1,"does":1,"connecting":1,"check":1,"got":1,"cause":1,"price":1,"wuss":1,"obscenities":1,"knowing":1,"be":3,"we":2,"who":3,"run":1,"really":1,"do":1,"schedule":1,"clerk":1,"never":1,"answers":1,"hundreds":1,"blame":2,"if":1,"no":5,"although":1,"along":1,"...":3,"by":1,"card":1,"wait":1,"every":1,"passengers":1,"about":4,"mans":1,"ok":1,"would":2,"anything":1,"face":2,"many":1,"coral":2,"hours":1,"experience":2,"leaving":1,"credit":1,"airport":1,"her":2,"airline":2,"faces":1,"loud":2,"asked":1,"missing":1,"first":1,"load":1,"golden":2,"already":3,"apple":1,"can":1,"sky":1,"in\/rescheduling":1,"one":2,"down":1,"lies":1,"everyone":2,"thought":1,"another":1,"blank":1,"ring":1,"insult":1,"your":7,"front-man":1,"city":1,"he":8,"from":3,"..":1,"&":1,"help":1,"angry":1,"destination":1,"airlines":1,"long":1,"next":1,"-":4,"needed":1,"much":3,"dont":1,"way":1,"6":1,"biggest":1,"themselves":1,".":24,"listen":1,"gotten":1,"``":3,"only":1,"flight":2,"knows":1,"offer":2,"spirit":7,"hotel":1,"gas":1,"took":1,"new":2,"else":2,"landed":2,"kudos":1,"atlantic":1,"tall":1,"fishy":1,"bum":1,"known":1,"with":6,"than":1,"had":8,"me":3,"boarding":1,"myself":1,"made":1,"15":1,"look":1,"talking":1,"these":1,"was":8,"stuartist":3,"this":5,"up":2,"bed":1,"air":1,"n't":2,"customers":2,"surprised":1,"snored":1,"were":1,"scum":1,"didnt":2,"could":1,"at":1,"and":15,"crazy":1,"stranded":1,"have":1,"horrific":1,"give":2,"of":9,"is":6,"am":1,"it":8,"an":1,"''":3,"heard":1,"say":1,"his":5,"im":1,"guy":1,"blond":1,"in":6,"close":1,"stomach":1,"obnoxious":1,"stole":1,"everyday":1,"as":1,"sat":1,"!":14,"again":3,"afraid":1,"'ll":1,"us":2,"want":1,"thing":1,")":3,"pay":1,"make":1,"ashamed":1,"when":2,"any":3,"uttered":1,"read":1,"that":5,"other":1,"speaker":1,"jaw":1,"sick":1,"big":1,"answer":1,"gate":1,"you":9,"profiting":1,"life":2,"either":1,"sure":1,"ft":1,"transportation":1,"rude":1,"cancun":1,"knew":1,"tied":1,"push":1,"plane":6,"water":1,"such":1,"hair":1,"on":7,"nickname":1,"why":1,"single":1,"a":9,"forever":1,"short":1,"off":3,"minutes":1,"wife":1,"i":14,"pilot":4,"lines":1,"hungry":1,"or":3,"their":4,"which":1,"understaffed":1,"so":3,"scarf":1,"time":3,"very":1,"professional":1,"the":21,"away":1,"talk":1,"left":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":0}

Now that's cheap!  \n\nThroughout both of my flights I was mentally writing my yelp review and envisioned a 1 or 2 star review.  Today, though, as I sat down to write it though, I couldn't do it.\n\nYes, the planes are old.  My fellow travelers ridiculed the planes, the seats, the interiors on both flights.  \n\nYes, there are lots of fees.  But it is possible to travel without paying any of them, especially if you are traveling by yourself or if you are going only on a short trip.  The $135 I paid was the total and included tax.  I paid no fees.    I didn't reserve a seat (and despite this I still had an aisle seat both ways).  I didn't pay a bag fee and instead brought only a small backback which fit underneath the seat.  Yes, you have to pay for food or drink but this is true of many airlines.  If you have a problem with it, buy something in the airport.\n\nYes, the seats are small.  I'm not sure how but it definitely seems as if there are more seats than usual crammed onto the plane.  However, I'm 5  feet tall and small and so all was fine for me.  Those of you who are tall I'm sure have issues on most planes.\n\nIt's true.  I would prefer to fly on a 'fancier, newer plane.'  However, for short-haul trips and for the price, Spirit is a good deal.  The flights took off and arrived within 15 minutes of their scheduled time.  The staff were professional.  Really, I have no complaints and would recommend flying Spirit.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":3,"date":"2011-11-28","useful":1,"counts":{"all":1,"true":2,"both":3,"cheap":1,"135":2,"seats":3,"yes":4,"still":1,"fine":1,"issues":1,"staff":1,"write":1,"$":2,"fit":1,"(":1,"seems":1,",":16,"writing":1,"to":5,"flights":3,"going":1,"travelers":1,"scheduled":1,"do":1,"them":1,"good":1,"than":1,"food":1,"possible":1,"flew":1,"break":1,"vegas":1,"despite":1,"not":1,"during":1,"now":1,"down":1,"envisioned":1,"bag":1,"small":3,"did":2,"'fancier":1,"old":1,"deal":1,"short-haul":1,"seat":3,"are":7,"star":1,"portland":1,"really":1,"throughout":1,"for":5,"lots":1,"review":2,"paying":1,"drink":1,"planes":3,"however":2,"by":1,"on":4,"of":6,"could":1,"airport":1,"onto":1,"or":3,"flying":1,"ridiculed":1,"had":1,"within":1,"prefer":1,"yourself":1,"brought":1,"included":1,"fees":2,"total":1,"crammed":1,"fee":1,"from":1,"would":2,"there":2,"only":2,".":23,"their":1,"2":1,"recommend":1,"was":3,"today":1,"more":1,"buy":1,"aisle":1,"took":1,"but":3,"backback":1,"newer":1,"fellow":1,"with":1,"spirit":2,"those":1,"especially":1,"me":1,"15":1,"this":2,"interiors":1,"n't":3,"were":1,"problem":1,"my":3,"trips":1,"feet":1,"traveling":1,"and":9,"minutes":1,"is":3,"tax":1,"it":6,"an":1,"fly":1,"as":2,"something":1,"have":4,"in":1,"trip":1,"sat":1,"!":1,"no":2,")":1,"pay":2,"travel":1,"that":1,"any":1,"1":1,"how":1,"without":1,"5":1,"airlines":1,"which":1,"instead":1,"you":5,"if":4,"sure":2,"'s":2,"though":2,"price":1,"who":1,"paid":2,"most":1,"plane":2,"arrived":1,"tall":2,"complaints":1,"'m":3,"mentally":1,"a":8,"underneath":1,"short":1,"off":1,"'":1,"yelp":1,"i":14,"many":1,"thanksgiving":1,"ways":1,"definitely":1,"so":1,"time":1,"professional":1,"the":13,"reserve":1,"usual":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":0}

Flight #245.\n\nPersonally, I am not that big of a fan of Spirit airlines due to the fact that they charge you for everything, the plane feels smaller than most, and the customer support is genuinely terrible. So if this were a review for that it would be like, negative 3 stars.\n\nBut it isn't. This review is for the flight attendants that were working fight #245 on 8\/7\/15 as I mentioned above. If I remember correctly, the male flight attendant's name was Kenneth and throughout the fight he was friendly, joked around with passengers, while at the same time maintaining a very professional demeanor. \n\nYou may ask how someone joking around can maintain a professional demeanor and in regards to that, I can't really explain. But I have flown countless flights, and he did something that I've only seen once before and made me think, \"Excellent work sir\".\n\nThe other person that was outstanding was the female African American fight attendant that took the time to compliment my Ewoking Dead shirt. The entire flight she seemed like she was in a good mood and like Kenneth, just seemed genuinely friendly.\n\nI attempted to call Spirit to let them know about their outstanding employees but after explaining a story similar to this one the person on the customer service line said, \"I'm sorry sir, your phone was breaking up, what did you want?\"\n\nSo I tried again, but the person was fairly useless but assured me she would send a message to her supervisor. I asked if I could just tell the supervisor and cut out the middle man and was told the supervisor was very busy. When I asked if there was a Complaint\/Compliment division where I could you know, compliment these two people I was informed, \"I'm sorry sir, we don't have that.\"\n\nSo again, on the Spirit airlines side of things just an absolute nightmare. So thank you Spirt Airlines flight #245 flight attendants. You were an oasis amidst a very dismal incompetent ugly storm and I appreciate it immensely. I will try to call again tomorrow and see if I can track down an elusive supervisor in the hopes that you will receive some type of recognition for being great.","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":5,"date":"2015-08-08","useful":0,"counts":{"rating":1,"just":3,"being":1,"personally":1,"8\/7\/15":2,"seen":1,"customer":2,"mentioned":1,"before":1,"cut":1,"thank":1,"how":1,"explain":1,",":19,"send":1,"than":1,"to":9,"complaint\/compliment":1,"sorry":2,"he":2,"friendly":2,"useless":1,"do":1,"them":1,"someone":1,"around":2,"very":3,"big":1,"she":3,"feels":1,"vegas":1,"fan":1,"know":2,"they":1,"not":1,"maintaining":1,"like":3,"entire":1,"name":1,"joked":1,"did":2,"plane":1,"'ve":1,"try":1,"this":4,"compliment":2,"where":1,"side":1,"smaller":1,"joking":1,"people":1,"some":1,"dead":1,"demeanor":2,"see":1,"'s":1,"message":1,"recognition":1,"really":1,"n't":3,"#":3,"said":1,"mood":1,"for":5,"track":1,"review":3,"\/":1,"your":1,"everything":1,"3":1,"above":1,"seemed":2,"spirt":1,"?":1,"told":1,"be":1,"we":1,"working":2,"assured":1,"negative":1,"245":3,"oasis":1,"busy":1,"let":1,"ask":1,"attendant":2,"passengers":1,"about":1,"would":2,"receive":1,"of":4,"employees":1,"terrible":1,"american":1,"her":1,"due":1,"think":1,"genuinely":2,"ca":1,"one":1,"down":1,"female":1,"immensely":1,"throughout":1,"tomorrow":1,"story":1,"from":1,"service":1,"support":1,"there":1,"informed":1,"charge":1,"amidst":1,"fight":4,"their":1,"call":2,"storm":1,"time":2,"las":1,"was":11,"tell":1,"correctly":1,"attendants":3,"``":3,"only":2,"flight":7,"stars":1,"that":11,"attempted":1,"took":1,"but":5,"phone":1,"regards":1,"dismal":1,"ewoking":1,"excellent":1,"hopes":1,"line":1,"with":1,"spirit":3,"countless":1,"me":2,"explaining":1,"made":1,"these":1,"type":1,"work":1,"up":1,"incompetent":1,"will":2,"ugly":1,"while":1,"outstanding":2,"can":2,"were":4,"male":1,"similar":1,"could":2,"at":1,"and":10,"flights":1,"supervisor":4,"san":1,"kenneth":2,"division":1,"is":4,"am":1,"it":3,"an":3,"''":3,"middle":1,"as":1,"good":1,"out":1,"something":1,"have":2,"in":3,"my":1,"6:16pm":1,"absolute":1,"again":3,"shirt":1,"want":1,"things":1,"breaking":1,"when":1,"same":1,".":18,"other":1,"airlines":3,"you":7,"if":5,"fairly":1,"star":1,"tried":1,"diego":1,"may":1,"after":1,"what":1,"most":1,"flown":1,"sir":3,"two":1,"'m":2,"on":5,"man":1,"a":9,"elusive":1,"remember":1,"i":18,"appreciate":1,"asked":2,"person":3,"maintain":1,"so":4,"african":1,"great":1,"professional":2,"the":21,"nightmare":1,"fact":1,"once":1},"type":"review","class":1,"cool":2}

We went back and the Next  flight wasn't until the next night leaving us stranded in BWI over night. We caught a earlier flight with another airline as we needed to be in vegas on time for a government meeting the following morning. We already payed and booked a return flight home with spirit along with another $160 in baggage too.  When time came around to return on home on our scheduled flight. Spirit canceled our flight took all of our money and baggage fee's and wouldn't allow us on the flight. They sayed that if we didn't fly to vegas with them then they automatically cancel our return. We flew in another airline cause there craft wasn't until the last flight the following night n we need to be there in the morning: they wouldn't reinstate our flight reservations even though we payed for 2 airline seat tickets and baggage on the return flight.

To be clear, Spirit Airlines did eventually make things right with me, but it took a ridiculous amount of effort on my part to get my money back.\n\nThe history:  I booked two non-stop tickets from the bay area to Las Vegas with Spirit Airlines through Travelocity (I will be reviewing them later).  It is only an hour or so flight, so I was very specific about picking non-stop flights.  My credit card was charged for the tickets and I received a confirmation email reflecting the flights I had selected.  About a month later, I went to check some information through the confirmation email and clicked a link to a more detailed itinerary of my trip.  To my surprise, my flights had completely changed! The departure and arrival times had changed significantly.  Also, I had a one hour layover at LAX on the way to Vegas and a FOUR HOUR layover on the way home.  I never gave permission or even received notice of the changes.\n\nI immediately called Travelocity and was told that they didn't make the changes and would not assist since Spirit is a discount carrier.  I called Spirit Airlines and was told that it was Travelocity's fault.  Ultimately, I made a totally of twelve phone calls in order to get this resolved.  Two to Travelocity and TEN to Spirit.  They made various attempts to make it my problem... \"We can change your flights back, but it will cost $200 per ticket\", then \"We will change your flights back for free, but will not guarantee that you will keep those flights\", then \"We will ensure you get the original flights you booked\".  At this point, I was more than done dealing with them.  I found it unbelievable that they were not admitting fault immediately and resolving the issue.  I demanded my money back and was met with a steady stream of rude resistance.  I told them I would not be using the flights as I was not comfortable flying with a business that conducted business so unethically.  I was offered a credit to use in the future.  At that point, I told the customer service rep that I would NEVER under any circumstances be using their airline and that if my money was not refunded I would be contacting the appropriate authorities.  She finally gave in and agreed to refund the money, but would not give me her name or send a confirmation email.

It was cheap and a great deal however what we didn't pay with money we paid with our time and extra fees. We went to online check in the day before our trip to Vegas. We then found out that spirit has you pay extra fees for seats with the other people you are flying with plus baggage. We thought well that stinks but we did it. We then day off went to make sure everything was paid for and our seats had disappeared but my card was charged. We called and instead of spirit being able to just get us new seats together because I already paid, they made us pay an extra $50 dollars. They made no effort to fix it at all. Just said there are new fees and here they are you either pay it or you can't sit together. So we paid it and moved on. Now we are set to fly out tomorrow and the seats we paid for our return trip are all messed up again. We are currently on the phone with Spirit and they are saying that we went on there and messed up the seats. Yes, Spirit we wanted to intentionally remove your expensive seats we double paid for and then re-buy them, not sitting together.

Do yourself a huge favor and just spend the extra $80-100 and fly another airline. The aircrafts themselves are extremely cheap and the seats feel like you are sitting on a milk crate the whole plane ride. Space between you and the other passenger in front of you in non-existent. They DO NOT have FIRST CLASS but instead they offer something cheesy called \"The Big Seat\".. **crickets** wait what? Just say no!","business_id":"dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w","stars":1,"date":"2016-09-29","useful":1,"counts":{"refund":1,"just":2,"camel":1,"issued":1,"cheap":1,"course":1,"delays":1,"seats":1,"earth":1,"still":1,"milk":1,"now":1,"$":1,"front":1,"explain":1,"approved":1,"had":1,"employer":1,"to":5,"only":1,"fares":1,"sent":1,"then":2,"them":2,"get":1,"crate":1,"couple":2,"tricking":1,"interview":1,"know":1,"they":4,"awful":1,"one":1,"sucked":1,"like":1,"originally":1,"because":1,"people":1,"back":2,"seat":1,"likely":1,"service":1,"are":3,"really":1,"even":1,"what":1,"for":2,"space":1,"movie":1,"favor":1,"between":1,"got":1,"ever":1,"?":5,"be":3,"business":2,"80-100":1,"job":1,"card":1,"wait":2,"on":2,"would":3,"luggage":1,"of":2,"could":1,"days":1,"times":1,"credit":1,"airline":3,"whole":1,"or":1,"first":1,"love":1,"extra":1,"feel":1,"into":2,"yourself":1,"another":2,"cheesy":1,"city":1,"story":1,"takes":1,"..":1,"agree":1,"flying":1,"long":1,".":5,"their":1,"low":1,"themselves":1,"was":4,"``":1,"flight":2,"offer":2,"successful":1,"delayed":1,"but":3,"yeah":1,"broke":1,"**crickets**":1,"ratchet":1,"with":2,"fly":1,"this":3,"ride":1,"soul":1,"ungodly":1,"charges":1,"aircrafts":1,"slapping":1,"my":2,"called":1,"something":1,"and":8,"passenger":1,"non-existent":1,"do":2,"is":4,"it":5,"an":2,"''":1,"canceled":1,"say":1,"customer":1,"have":2,"in":5,"seen":1,"everyday":1,"as":1,"if":1,"!":4,"huge":1,"no":2,"not":2,"sitting":1,"when":1,"how":2,"that":6,"other":1,"big":1,"answer":1,"instead":1,"you":6,"used":1,"'s":1,"may":2,"most":1,"plane":2,"extremely":1,"class":1,"a":6,"purchase":1,"short":1,"i":6,"so":1,"time":1,"the":13,"spend":1,"straw":1},"type":"review","class":0,"cool":1}
